Artifact Resubmission Summary:

We have updated the artifact to address all reviewer comments:

Artifact hash: Added the correct git commit hash corresponding to this version, ensuring a unique, verifiable snapshot.

Kick-the-tyres scripts: All three designated scripts (plot_weighted_grade.py, plot_histogram_by_difficulty.py, analyze_CodeGen.py) have been verified to run correctly using only the provided CSVs under results/. No hardcoded local paths remain.

Claim 2 updates: analyze_Explain.py is now verified runnable, producing the final Explain_percentages.csv from provided processed data. Running this script before plot_histogram_by_difficulty.py allows full verification of Claim 2 without any intermediate files.

Intermediate/omitted files: We clarified that some preprocessing and grader output files are intentionally omitted due to dependency on LearnOCaml or non-deterministic LLM outputs. All scripts required for the kick-the-tyres evaluation run independently of these omitted files.

CSV/figure consistency: Paths and filenames in the README and scripts now exactly match the files in the repository. Figure 5 and Figure 6 are reproducible as described.

Documentation improvements: README.md now explicitly explains which scripts are for inspection only, which files are final, and provides step-by-step instructions that reproduce the key results from the paper.

All changes ensure that the artifact can be evaluated fully based on the final processed results and that reviewers can verify the claims without access to intermediate or non-deterministic data.

Solution: Let α be any type. Then 't = α, 's = α, and 'u = α.

Explanation: Since f has type ('t * 's → 'u) and we use f in both f(a, b) and f(b, a), we require that a (of type 't) and b (of type 's) swap roles, forcing 't = 's. Further, f(a, b) returns a value of type 'u but is used as the first component in another call to f which expects a value of type 't, so 'u must equal 't. Thus, all three type variables must be the same.

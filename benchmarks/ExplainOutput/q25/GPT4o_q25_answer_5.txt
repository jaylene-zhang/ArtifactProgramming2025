### Solution:
The most general instantiation for the type variables is:
- `'t = 'u`
- `'s = 'u`

---

### Explanation:
1. The function `f` has type `('t * 's -> 'u)`, which means it takes a tuple `(x, y)` of types `'t` and `'s` respectively, and returns a value of type `'u`.

2. In `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))`, the first argument of `f` is itself an application of `f`. For `f (a, b)`:
   - `a` (of type `'t`) and `b` (of type `'s`) are passed to `f`, so the result of `f (a, b)` is of type `'u`.

3. Similarly, for `f (b, a)`:
   - `b` (of type `'s`) and `a` (of type `'t`) are passed to `f`, so the result of `f (b, a)` is also of type `'u`.

4. Now, the call `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` implies that the input tuple to the outer `f` consists of two elements, both of type `'u`. Hence, the outer `f`'s type must be `('u * 'u -> 'u)`.

5. To satisfy this, the type `'t` and `'s` must both unify with `'u` to ensure type consistency across all applications of `f`.

Thus, the most general instantiation is `'t = 'u` and `'s = 'u`.

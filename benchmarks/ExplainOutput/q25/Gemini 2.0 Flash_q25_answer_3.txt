**Solution:**

*   `'t` = `'s`
*   `'u` = `'u`

**Explanation:**

1.  **Innermost `f` calls:** `f (a, b)` has type `'u` and `f (b, a)` also has type `'u`.

2.  **Outermost `f` call:**  For `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` to be valid, the first argument to the outer `f` (which is `f(a, b)`) must have type `'t` and the second argument (which is `f(b, a)`) must have type `'s`. Since both `f(a, b)` and `f(b, a)` have type `'u`, this implies `'t = 'u` and `'s = 'u`.

3. The expression `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` requires that the type of `a` and `b` must be the same so `'t = 's`.

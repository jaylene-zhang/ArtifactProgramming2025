**Solution**

't = 'u, 's = 't, 'u = 't

**Explanation**

To determine the most general instantiation for the type variables, we substitute the argument `f (a, b)` for `x` and `f (b, a)` for `y` in the definition of `f`. Assuming `f` has type `'t * 's -> 'u`, we get:

`f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` is equivalent to `f (x, y)`, which has type `'u`. 

So, by unification, we conclude that `'t = 'u` for the first argument of `f` and `'s = 't` for the second argument of `f`. Since `f` has type `'t * 's -> 'u`, we can substitute `'t` for `'u` to get the result type.

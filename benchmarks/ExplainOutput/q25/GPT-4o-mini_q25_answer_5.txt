The most general instantiation for the type variables is:

- 't: 'u
- 's: 'u
- 'u: 'v

With these instantiations, the function `f` has the type `('u * 'u -> 'v)`, ensuring that both `f(a, b)` and `f(b, a)` return values of type 'u, which can then be used as inputs for another call to `f`.

### Explanation:
1. For `f` to accept inputs of type `('t * 's)`, the types of `a` and `b` must match `('t * 's)`. In this case, we choose `a` and `b` to be of the same type, which is set as `'u`.

2. Consequently, the outputs of `f(a, b)` and `f(b, a)`, both resulting in type 'v, can be used as inputs for a subsequent call to `f`, which leads us to define `f`'s output type as `'v`.

3. The composition `f(f(a, b), f(b, a))` therefore takes two arguments of type `'u`, producing a result of type `'v`, fitting our requirement perfectly.

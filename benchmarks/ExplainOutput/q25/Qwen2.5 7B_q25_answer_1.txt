Solution: 'u

Explanation: The function `f` is defined to take a pair of any two types and return a value of type 'u. Since `a` is of type 't and `b` is of type 's, `f (a, b)` will have type 'u. Similarly, `f (b, a)` will also have type 'u. Therefore, when we pass these results back into `f`, the type of `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` will be 'u, as specified by the type of `f`. The type variables 't, 's, and 'u remain general and can be any types, but the output type of the nested function calls will always be 'u as dictated by the type signature of `f`.

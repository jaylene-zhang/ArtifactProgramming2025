Solution:

*   `'t = 's = 'u`

Explanation:

1.  `f (a, b)` has type `'u`.
2.  `f (b, a)` has type `'u`.
3.  Therefore, `(f (a, b), f (b, a))` has type `'u * 'u`.
4.  For `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` to be valid, the first argument of `f` must have type `'t` and the second argument must have type `'s`. So, it must be that `'u = 't` and `'u = 's`.
5.  Combining the above we find that `'t = 's = 'u`.

**(6, 5)**

The `shift_point` function uses the original `point` value `(5, 4)`, not the reassigned `point` value. The order of evaluation in OCaml is from top to bottom, so when `shift_point` is defined, the original `point` is still `(5, 4)`. The reassignment of `point` after the definition of `shift_point` does not affect the behavior of `shift_point`.

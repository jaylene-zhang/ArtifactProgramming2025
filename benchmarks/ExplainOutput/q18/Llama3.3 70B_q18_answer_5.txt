**(6, 5)**

Explanation: The initial values of `point` are overridden by the new values in the line `let point = shift_point 1`. So the new values of `point` become `(6, 5)`. When `shift_point 2` is called, it adds `2` to the components of the new `point`, resulting in `(6+2, 5+2)` which equals `(8, 7)`.

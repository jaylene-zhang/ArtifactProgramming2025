The program will result in an error when it tries to execute `shift_point 2`. 

**Explanation:** In the OCaml code, `point` is redefined after calling `shift_point 1` which changes `point` to the new value `(6, 5)`. However, since `point` is now defined as `(6, 5)`, calling `shift_point` again would lead to using the newly assigned `point` but the `shift_point` function is not dependent on any argument. Instead, it uses the original definition of `point`, which was `(5, 4)`. This might cause confusion but the critical issue is that, as is, `shift_point` doesn’t accept an argument and will not work properly with a new definition of `point`. If you meant to ask whether `shift_point` could take an argument, the way it’s defined means it cannot do so directly without modifying the function itself accordingly. 

To fix it, `shift_point` should take an input `point` and shift it accordingly.

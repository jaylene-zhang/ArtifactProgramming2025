**Solution:**  
The program `shift_point 2` will return `(8, 7)`.

**Explanation:**  
1. Initially, `point` is defined as `(5, 4)`.
2. `shift_point` accepts a parameter `n` and shifts the `point`'s components by `n`:  
   `(component_x point + n, component_y point + n)`.
3. However, after the line `let point = shift_point 1`, the value of `point` is updated to `(6, 5)` because `shift_point 1` shifts `(5, 4)` by 1.
4. Now, when calling `shift_point 2`, the updated `point` `(6, 5)` is used:  
   `component_x (6, 5) + 2 = 6 + 2 = 8` and `component_y (6, 5) + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7`.  
   Hence, the result is `(8, 7)`.

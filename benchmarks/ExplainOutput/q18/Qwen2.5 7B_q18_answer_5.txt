``ocaml
(6, 5)
```

**Explanation:**
- The initial `point` is `(5, 4)`.
- `shift_point n` computes a new point by adding `n` to both coordinates of `point`.
- When `shift_point 1` is called, it returns `(6, 5)`.
- The statement `let point = shift_point 1` assigns this new point to `point`.
- When `shift_point 2` is finally called, it adds `2` to both coordinates of the new `point`, resulting in `(6 + 2, 5 + 2)`, which simplifies to `(8, 7)`.

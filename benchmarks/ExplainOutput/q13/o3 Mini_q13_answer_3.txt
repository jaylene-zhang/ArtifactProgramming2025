Solution:
let counter = ref 0 in
(counter := !counter + 1; !counter)

Explanation:
This example overwrites the value inside the mutable reference "counter" using the assignment operator (:=). In contrast, overshadowing (or shadowing) occurs when a new variable with the same name is declared in a nested scope, hiding the outer one without changing its value.

**Example of Overwriting:**

```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let x = 10 in
x
```

**Explanation:**
In this example, `x` is initially bound to `5`, and then it is overwritten by a new binding of `10`. Overwriting in OCaml refers to creating a new binding for an existing variable in the same scope, effectively replacing the old value for subsequent uses of that variable.

**Difference from Overshadowing:**
Overshadowing occurs when a variable with the same name is introduced in a nested scope, hiding the outer variable. For instance:

```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let y = x + 2 in
let x = 10 in
(y, x)
```

Here, the `x` in the inner scope is different from the `x` in the outer scope. The outer `x` is ignored (or overshadowed) within the inner scope. In contrast, overwriting would just change the value of `x` in a way that it remains the same variable but has a new value.

Solution:
  
  let x = ref 0 in
  x := 1;    (* Overwrites the contents of x with 1 *)
  !x         (* Returns 1 *)

Explanation:
• Overwriting changes the contents of an existing mutable value in place (like ref contents).  
• Overshadowing introduces a new binding with the same name, hiding the old one in that scope. The original value or binding remains unchanged in memory, just out of scope.

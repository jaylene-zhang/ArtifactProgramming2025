# Overwriting

```ocaml
let x = 5

let rec f y =
  let x = y in
  let () = print_endline ("x before if-statement: " ^ string_of_int x);
  if y > 0 then
    let x = -5 in
    let () = print_endline ("x in if-body  : " ^ string_of_int x);
    x
  else
    let () = print_endline ("x in else-body  : " ^ string_of_int x);
    x

let _ = print_endline ("x in result-hole  : " ^ string_of_int (f 10))
;```

Explanation:
Overwriting is a process in which an existing variable name is given a new value, replacing the old one.

# Overshadowing

```ocaml
let rec f y =
  let x = y in
  let () = print_endline ("x before if-statement: " ^ string_of_int x);
  if y > 0 then
    let x = 10 in
    let () = print_endline ("x in if-body  : " ^ string_of_int x);
    x
  else
    let () = print_endline ("x in else-body  : " ^ string_of_int x);
    x

let _ = print_endline ("x in result-hole  : " ^ string_of_int (f 10))
;```

Explanation:
Overshadowing occurs when a new binding is declared with the same name as an existing one, but is "deeper" in the scope. In this case, `x` is only scoped to the recursive calls of `f` and is thus overwritten when you make another assignment to it.

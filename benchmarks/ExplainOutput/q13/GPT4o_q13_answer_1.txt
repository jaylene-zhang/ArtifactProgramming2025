### Solution:
#### Example of Overwriting:
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let x = 10;; (* Overwrites the previous value of x *)
```

#### Example of Overshadowing:
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let f () =
  let x = 10 in (* Shadows the outer x *)
  x;;
```

### Explanation:
- **Overwriting** happens when a variable is redefined in the same scope, effectively replacing its previous definition (e.g., `let x = 5` followed by `let x = 10`).
- **Overshadowing** occurs when a new variable with the same name is introduced in a nested or different scope, temporarily "hiding" the outer variable but not modifying it (e.g., redeclaring `x` locally inside a function).

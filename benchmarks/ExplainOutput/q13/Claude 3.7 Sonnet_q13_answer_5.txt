```ocaml
let x = ref 5 in
x := 10;
!x  (* Result: 10 *)
```

Overwriting changes the value stored at a memory location through a reference. The original value (5) is replaced by a new value (10) in the same memory location.

Overshadowing, on the other hand, creates a new binding with the same name in a nested scope:

```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let x = 10 in  (* This creates a new binding that shadows the outer x *)
x  (* Result: 10, but the outer x still exists and still equals 5 *)
```

In overshadowing, the original value continues to exist but is temporarily inaccessible, while overwriting permanently changes the value at a memory location.

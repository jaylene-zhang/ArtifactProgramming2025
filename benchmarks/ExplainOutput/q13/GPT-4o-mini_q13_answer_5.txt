### Example of Overwriting in OCaml:
```ocaml
let x = 10
let x = 20  (* This overwrites the previous definition of x *)
```

### Explanation:
In OCaml, overwriting occurs when a variable is redefined in the same scope with a new value, effectively replacing the original value. In the example, `x` is first set to `10` and then redefined to `20`. 

Overshadowing, on the other hand, happens when a variable defined in a local scope has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. In this case, the local variable "shadows" the outer one, but does not change it. For instance:
```ocaml
let x = 10 in
  let x = 20 in
    x  (* This x is 20, but the outer x is still 10 *)
```
Here, the inner `x` shadows the outer one, but both exist simultaneously instead of one overwriting the other.

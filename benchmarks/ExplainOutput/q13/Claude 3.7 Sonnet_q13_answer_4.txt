**Example of overwriting:**
```ocaml
let x = ref 5
let () = x := 10
```

**Explanation:** 
Overwriting modifies the contents of a mutable data structure in-place. In this example, the reference `x` initially contains the value 5, then its contents are overwritten with 10. The identity of the reference remains the same.

Overshadowing, in contrast, creates a new binding with the same name in an inner scope that temporarily hides an outer binding. For example:
```ocaml
let x = 5 in
  let x = 10 in
    (* Here x is 10 *)
    x + 1
  (* Outside this scope, x is still 5 *)
```
With overshadowing, multiple separate bindings exist at different scopes, while overwriting changes the content of a single mutable binding.

Example of overwriting:
```ocaml
let x = ref 5
let _ = x := 10 (* x now contains 10, the original value 5 is overwritten *)
```

Overwriting changes the value stored at a particular memory location, modifying the existing data in-place. The variable still points to the same location in memory, but the contents have changed.

Overshadowing (or shadowing) is different:
```ocaml
let x = 5
let x = 10 (* This creates a new binding named x in the current scope *)
```

With shadowing, a new binding with the same name is created in a new scope, hiding (but not modifying) the original binding. The original value still exists and can be accessed again when the inner scope ends.

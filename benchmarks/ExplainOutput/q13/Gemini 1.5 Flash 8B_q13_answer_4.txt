**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 10;;

let x = 20;;

let y = 30;;

let x = 40;;

print_int x;; (* Output: 40 *)
```

**Explanation:**

Overwriting in OCaml (and generally in programming) refers to the assignment of a new value to a variable that already exists.  Each assignment rebinds the variable (updates the variable's association to a new value).  The earlier value is discarded. This is different from *shadowing*, which involves introducing a variable with the same name in a nested lexical scope.  The nested variable, although with the same name, does not change the binding of the outer variable.  Overwriting replaces the existing binding directly.

### Solution:
#### Overwriting Example:
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let x = 10;; (* x is overwritten with a new value *)
```

#### Overshadowing Example:
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let f () =
  let x = 10 in (* x is overshadowed within the function scope *)
  x;;
```

### Explanation:
- **Overwriting** occurs when a variable is redefined in the same scope, completely replacing its earlier binding. In the first example, `x` (initially 5) is overwritten with `x = 10`.
- **Overshadowing** happens when a new variable with the same name is introduced in a nested or smaller scope, while the original binding remains unchanged outside of this scope. In the second example, `x` inside the function temporarily shadows the outer `x`, but the outer `x` (5) is still accessible outside the function.

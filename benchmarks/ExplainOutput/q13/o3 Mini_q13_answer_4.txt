Solution:
Overwriting example:
 let x = ref 42 in
 x := 99; 
 !x
Overshadowing example:
 let x = 42 in
 let x = x + 1 in
 x

Explanation:
In the overwriting example, the mutable reference x is updated to a new value (99) using the assignment operator (:=); the change affects the same memory location. In contrast, overshadowing creates a new, inner binding for the name x that hides the outer x without modifying it.

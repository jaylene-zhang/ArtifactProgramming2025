Solution:
• let r = ref 3;;  
• r := 5;;

Explanation:
Here, r is a mutable reference holding 3, and r := 5 overwrites its value to 5 (mutation). In contrast, overshadowing occurs when a new binding (e.g., using “let”) in a nested scope uses the same name to hide the outer one without changing its stored value.

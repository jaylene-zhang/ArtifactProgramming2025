### Solution:
#### Overwriting Example:
```ocaml
let x = 10
let x = 20
```

Explanation:
- **Overwriting** involves re-declaring a variable (e.g., `x`) in the same scope or context, replacing its previous value. In the example above, `x` initially has the value `10`, but it is "overwritten" with the value `20`.
  
#### Overshadowing:
- In contrast, **overshadowing** occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope (e.g., inside a function or block) has the same name as a variable in an outer scope. The inner variable "shadows" the outer one for the duration of its scope.

Example of overshadowing:
```ocaml
let x = 10
let f () =
  let x = 20 in
  x
```

Above, the `x` inside the function `f` *overshadows* the outer `x` only within the function. However, outside `f`, `x` is still `10`.

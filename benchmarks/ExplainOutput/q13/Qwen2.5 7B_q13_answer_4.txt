**Solution:**
```ml
let x = 10 in
let x = 20 in
x
```

**Explanation:**
In this example, `x` is assigned the value `10` and then immediately reassigned to `20`. When the expression `x` is evaluated, it returns `20`. This is overwriting because the variable `x` is being assigned a new value, replacing the old one.

**Overwriting vs. Overshadowing:**
- **Overwriting:** Reassigning a new value to an existing variable, effectively replacing the old value.
- **Overshadowing:** Using a local binding to hide a binding in an outer scope, but the original binding still exists. In the example, if we used a function parameter or let binding, the outer `x` would still be accessible as it is in a different scope. For example:
  ```ml
  let x = 10
  let foo () =
    let x = 20 in
    x
  in
  foo()
  ```
  Here, `x` inside `foo` overshadows the outer `x`, but the outer `x` is still `10`.

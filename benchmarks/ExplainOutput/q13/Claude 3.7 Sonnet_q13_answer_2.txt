```ocaml
let x = ref 5;;
x := 10;;   (* overwriting *)
```

Overwriting occurs when we modify the contents of a mutable reference using assignment (`:=`). The value stored at the memory location is replaced with a new value.

Overshadowing (or shadowing) is different:
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let x = 10;;  (* overshadowing *)
```

With overshadowing, we create a new binding with the same name in a nested scope, which hides (but doesn't modify) the original binding. The original binding still exists and becomes accessible again when we exit the scope where shadowing occurred.

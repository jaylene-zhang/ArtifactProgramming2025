**Example of Overwriting:**
```ocaml
let x = ref 5;;
x := 10;;  (* x is overwritten with value 10 *)
```

**Explanation:** 
Overwriting modifies the value stored at a particular memory location. In the example, we change the value in the reference `x` from 5 to 10. The original value is completely replaced.

Shadowing, on the other hand, creates a new binding with the same name in a nested scope while the original binding remains intact in its scope:
```ocaml
let x = 5 in
  let x = 10 in
    (* Here x is 10 *)
    print_int x
  (* Outside the inner scope, x is still 5 *)
```

With shadowing, the original binding is unmodified and can be accessed again once the inner scope ends.

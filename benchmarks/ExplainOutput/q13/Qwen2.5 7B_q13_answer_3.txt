**Example of Overwriting:**

```ocaml
let a = 5;;
let a = 10;;  (* Overwrites the value of a *)
```

**Explanation:**
Overwriting in OCaml occurs when you reassign a value to an existing identifier, as shown above. The old value associated with `a` (which was `5`) is replaced by the new value (`10`).

**Difference from Overshadowing:**

In overshadowing, a new binding is created, which does not affect the existing binding of the same identifier. Here's an example of overshadowing:

```ocaml
let a = 5;;
let a () = () ;;  (* Creates a new function a, but the value 5 is not affected *)
```

**Explanation:**
Overshadowing creates a new binding with the same identifier (`a`), but it does not overwrite the existing value. The variable `a` can now refer to a function, while the integer value `5` remains accessible. Overwriting would replace the entire binding, whereas overshadowing introduces a new binding without changing the old one.

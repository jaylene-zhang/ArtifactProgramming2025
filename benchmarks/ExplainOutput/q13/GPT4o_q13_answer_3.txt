**Solution**:  
Overwriting in OCaml can happen when you define a value with the same name in the same scope, which effectively replaces the previous binding:

```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let x = 10;; (* The previous value of x is overwritten *)
```

**Explanation**:  
- Overwriting occurs when a new binding with the same name replaces an earlier binding in the same scope.
- Overshadowing, on the other hand, happens when an inner scope introduces a new binding with the same name as a value from an outer scope, without modifying the original value:

```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let () =
  let x = 10 in  (* x here overshadows the outer x *)
  Printf.printf "%d\n" x;;
Printf.printf "%d\n" x;; (* Outer x remains unaffected *)
```
Here, `x` within the inner scope overshadows the outer `x`. Unlike overwriting, the outer `x` is still accessible outside the inner scope.

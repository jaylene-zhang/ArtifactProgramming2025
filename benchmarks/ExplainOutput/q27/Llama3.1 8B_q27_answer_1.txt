## Solution

Functional languages try to avoid state variables (references) and imperative-style programming with them because:

```ocaml
(* Imperative style with mutable references (BAD) *)
let x = ref 0

(* Benefits of functional programming (GOOD) *)
let x = 0
```

## Explanation

Functional languages aim to avoid mutable state because it can lead to:

*   Bugs: Shared mutable state can cause complex and difficult-to-debug interactions.
*   Non-determinism: Mutable state can introduce non-deterministic behavior and side effects.
*   Hairier code: Imperative style with mutable state often leads to heavier, more convoluted codebases.

Functional languages, like OCaml, instead use immutable data structures and pure functions to encourage:

*   Composability: Pure functions can be easily combined.
*   Predictability: Immutable data ensures predictable behavior.
*   Simplified code: Pure functions follow the composition pattern, making code more manageable and coherent.

**Solution:**  
Functional languages avoid state variables and imperative programming to ensure immutability, reduce side effects, simplify reasoning about code, and enable better optimization like parallelism.

**Explanation:**  
State variables introduce mutable state, making the program more error-prone and hard to debug due to unexpected changes. In contrast, immutability promotes predictable behavior and facilitates reasoning, testing, and concurrency, which aligns with the declarative nature of functional programming.

**Solution:**

To promote immutability, simplify reasoning, and enable easier parallelization.

**Explanation:**

*   **Immutability:**  Functional languages prefer immutable data.  State variables introduce mutability, making it harder to track changes and reason about program behavior.
*   **Reasoning:**  Without state changes, functions behave like mathematical functions: the output depends only on the input. This simplifies debugging and verification.
*   **Parallelization:**  Immutable data eliminates the need for locks and other synchronization primitives, making it easier to parallelize computations.

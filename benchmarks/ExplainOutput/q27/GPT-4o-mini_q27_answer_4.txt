Functional languages avoid state variables and imperative-style programming to promote immutable data, which leads to easier reasoning about code, better concurrency, and fewer side effects. Immutability helps in maintaining program correctness and facilitates referential transparency, allowing functions to be understood without concern for state changes.

In functional programming, the focus is on the flow of data and transformations rather than changing the state of variables. This design encourages the use of pure functions, which always produce the same output for the same input and do not alter external states. As a result, programs become more predictable, easier to test, and maintain, especially in multi-threaded environments where shared mutable state can lead to bugs and race conditions.

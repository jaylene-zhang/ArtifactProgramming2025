**Solution:**

To enhance reasoning, enable optimization, and facilitate parallelism.

**Explanation:**

*   **Reasoning:** Avoiding state makes code easier to reason about because the output of a function depends only on its inputs, not on the program's history. This simplifies debugging and verification.
*   **Optimization:** Without state, the compiler can freely reorder or eliminate computations without changing the program's meaning.
*   **Parallelism:** Lack of side effects enables easy parallelization since computations don't interfere with each other's state.

**Solution:**

To enhance immutability, simplify reasoning, and improve concurrency.

**Explanation:**

*   **Immutability:** Avoiding state variables promotes immutability, making code easier to reason about since values don't change unexpectedly.
*   **Simplified Reasoning:** Without mutable state, the value of an expression depends only on its inputs, not on the history of program execution.
*   **Concurrency:** Immutability eliminates the need for locks when multiple threads access the same data, improving concurrency.

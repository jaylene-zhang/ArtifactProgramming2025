**No Sharing of Mutable State**

Functional languages aim to avoid mutable state because it makes code harder to:

* Reason about
* Reproduce results
* Debug
* Test

Shared mutable state can lead to:

* Unintended effects
* Non-deterministic behavior
* Difficulty in testing and debugging 

**Pure Functions**

Functional languages promote the use of pure functions, which have no side effects and always produce the same output given the same inputs. This ensures predictable and reliable behavior.

**Immutable Data**

Immutable data ensures that once created, the data cannot be modified in place. This prevents unexpected behavior caused by modifying shared state.

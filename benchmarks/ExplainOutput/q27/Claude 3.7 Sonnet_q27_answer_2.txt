In functional languages, state variables are avoided because:

1. Immutable data makes reasoning about code easier - functions with the same inputs always produce the same outputs without side effects.
2. Referential transparency is preserved - expressions can be replaced with their values without changing program behavior.
3. Parallel execution becomes safer - without mutable state, concurrent operations don't lead to race conditions.
4. Function composition is simpler - pure functions compose predictably without hidden interactions through shared state.

State variables introduce side effects that make programs harder to understand, test, and maintain compared to pure functional approaches.

**Answers:**

a) False
b) True
c) True

**Explanation:**

a) The length of the definition does not directly affect the speed of the function. The time complexity of the function is what determines its speed.

b) The time complexity of the `@` operator in OCaml depends on the length of its first argument, not its second. However, in the context of `rev1`, the `@` operator is used with a list of length 1 as its second argument, but its first argument is the result of the recursive call `rev xs`, which can be large. This makes the time complexity of `rev1` O(n^2) because the `@` operator has to traverse the entire list `rev xs` for each recursive call.

c) `rev2` is indeed faster than `rev1` because it accumulates the reversed list using the `::` operator, which has a constant time complexity. The time complexity of `rev2` is O(n), making it more efficient than `rev1`. The recursive function `go` builds the reversed list incrementally, avoiding the need to traverse the entire list for each recursive call.

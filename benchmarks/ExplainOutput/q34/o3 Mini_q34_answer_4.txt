Solution:
a) False  
b) False  
c) True  

Explanation:
a) The brevity of the definition doesn’t impact performance.  
b) The (@) operator’s cost depends on its LEFT operand, not the second, making rev1 less efficient.  
c) rev2 is tail-recursive and uses (::), which operates in constant time, yielding linear performance.

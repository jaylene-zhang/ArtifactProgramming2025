Solution:
a) False  
b) False  
c) True

Explanation:
a) The shorter code in rev1 doesn’t imply faster performance.  
b) The ( @ ) operator’s cost depends on the length of its first argument, and in rev1 this cost causes quadratic time complexity.  
c) rev2 accumulates using (::), which is constant time, resulting in an overall linear time complexity.

Solution:
a) False  
b) False  
c) True  

Explanation:
a) The shorter definition of rev1 does not imply it is faster.  
b) The (@) operator’s time complexity depends on the length of its first argument, not its second, making rev1 perform poorly with many appends.  
c) rev2 uses tail recursion with the (::) operator, which is constant time, resulting in an overall linear time complexity.

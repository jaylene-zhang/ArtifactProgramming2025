a) False
- The definition length does not affect execution speed in this context. Both functions have similar structural complexity.

b) False
- While `@` can have a time complexity related to its second argument, this is not a decisive factor here. The recursion and list construction in `rev2` are more efficient for reversed lists.

c) True
- `rev2` is generally faster. It uses `::` to prepend elements to the accumulator from the start, which is efficient. `rev1` uses `@` for list concatenation, which involves creating a new list and copying elements, making it less efficient for large lists.

a) **False**.  Shorter code doesn't guarantee faster execution.  Time complexity is the critical factor.

b) **False**.  The time complexity of  `@` is *linear* in the length of the first list.  Since the first argument grows as the recursion unwinds, append is not optimized for this use case. The runtime depends on the size of the *whole* input.  It's not just the size of the second argument.

c) **True**.  `rev2` uses `::` which is constant time.  `rev1` uses `@` which is linear time.  Therefore, `rev2` will be more efficient.

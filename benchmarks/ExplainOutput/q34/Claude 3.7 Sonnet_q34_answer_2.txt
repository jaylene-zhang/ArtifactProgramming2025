a) False. The speed of a function is not determined by the length of its definition. The time complexity of the algorithm matters more than the number of lines of code.

b) False. This statement is incorrect, but not for the stated reason. The time complexity of (@) actually depends on the length of its first argument, not the second. rev1 is slower because it uses @ which has O(n) complexity, leading to an overall O(n²) complexity for rev1.

c) True. rev2 is faster than rev1 because it uses the (::) operation which has O(1) time complexity in each recursive step, resulting in an overall O(n) time complexity. rev1 uses (@) which makes it O(n²).

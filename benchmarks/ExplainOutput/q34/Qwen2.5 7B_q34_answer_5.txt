a) False  
Explanation: The length of the definition does not determine the performance. Performance depends on the operational complexity, not the size of the code.

b) False  
Explanation: While (`@`) (list concatenation) can have higher complexity, `rev2` uses an accumulating parameter which generally has better performance due to avoiding repeated concatenations.

c) True  
Explanation: `rev2` builds the reversed list by prepending elements to `acc` at each recursive step. This avoids multiple concatenations which are costly in `rev1`, resulting in better performance.

a) False.
The length of a function's definition doesn't determine its speed. Performance depends on the time complexity of the operations used, not the syntactic length of code.

b) False.
Actually, this makes rev1 slower, not faster. The time complexity of (@) depends on the length of the first argument, which is rev(xs) in this case. This leads to a quadratic O(n²) time complexity for rev1.

c) True.
rev2 is faster because it uses an accumulator pattern with (::) which is a constant time O(1) operation. This allows rev2 to achieve linear O(n) time complexity, while rev1 is quadratic O(n²) due to repeated list concatenation.

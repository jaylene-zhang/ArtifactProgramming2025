Here are the answers:

a) False.

b) True.

c) True.

**Explanations:**

*   **a) False:** Code length is not a reliable indicator of performance. `rev1` is less efficient.

*   **b) True:** The `@` operator in OCaml has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the *first* list. In `rev1`, `(rev xs)` can get long, so you have repeated linear operations.

*   **c) True:** `rev2` uses `::` for accumulation, which is a constant-time operation (O(1)). Therefore `rev2`'s time complexity is O(n). Since `rev1` is O(n^2) and `rev2` is O(n), `rev2` is faster than `rev1`.

Solution:
a) False  
b) False  
c) True

Explanation:
a) The number of lines doesn’t determine performance; rev1 uses ( @ ) which has poor time complexity.  
b) The ( @ ) operator’s cost depends on the length of its first argument, not the second.  
c) rev2 uses tail recursion with (::) to build the result, achieving linear time performance.

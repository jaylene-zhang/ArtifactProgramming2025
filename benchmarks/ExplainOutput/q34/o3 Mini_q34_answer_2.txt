Solution:
a) False  
b) False  
c) True

Explanation:
a) A shorter definition does not guarantee faster execution; rev1 uses ( @ ) repeatedly, which is inefficient.  
b) The ( @ ) operator’s cost depends on the length of its left operand, and in rev1 it leads to quadratic time, not faster execution.  
c) rev2 uses tail recursion with (::) to build the list in O(1) per step, resulting in linear-time reversal.

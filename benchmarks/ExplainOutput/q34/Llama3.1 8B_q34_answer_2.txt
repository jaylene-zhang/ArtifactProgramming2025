Here are the answers with explanations:

a) false
Incorrect because the time complexity of a function does not depend on its length of definition. Both functions have the same time complexity: O(n), where n is the length of the list being reversed.

b) false
Incorrect because the time complexity of the (@) operator (append) is O(m), where m is the length of the accumulator. However, in the worst-case scenario, the length of the accumulator is also the same as the length of the reversed list, so the total time complexity of rev1 becomes O(n + m) = O(2n). Still, this does not outperform the time complexity of rev2, which is also O(n).

c) true
Correct because the filter reducing the above factors and excluding addition overhead from the usage of `@` operator finally rev2 becomes more efficient. Rev2 is faster than rev1 as accumulator `::` in rev2 performs faster than appending using `@` in rev1

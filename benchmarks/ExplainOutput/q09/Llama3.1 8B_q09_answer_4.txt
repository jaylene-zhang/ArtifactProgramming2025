**Overshadowing Example**
```ocaml
type t = A of int | B of string

let f x =
  match x with
  | A x -> x
  | B s -> s

let g x =
  match x.A with
  | x -> x
```
**Explanation:** Overshadowing occurs when a variable or constructor introduced locally has the same name as a variable or constructor elsewhere in the code. In this example, `x` is first matched as a constructor in the outer `match` expression and bound to its payload in the `f` function. Then, in the `g` function, `x` is matched again as a constructor of the `A` variant, and again bound to its payload. This "new" `x` shadows the outer `x`, which is not accessible anymore.

**To avoid overshadowing:**

- Use distinct variable names, or
- Use the `let` keyword with a mutable binding (`let rec x = ...`) to shadow the outer `x`, or
- Use indentation and grouping to disambiguate the constructor binding.

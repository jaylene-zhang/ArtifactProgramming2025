**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let x = x + 10;;
print_int x;;
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing happens when a new variable is defined with the same name as an existing one, effectively "hiding" the earlier binding. In this program, the first `let x = 5` defines `x` and the second `let x = x + 10` overshadows it. The new `x` is now `15`, and the old `x = 5` is no longer accessible.

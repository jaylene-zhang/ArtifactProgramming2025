**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let x = x + 1 in (* overshadowing happens here *)
x;;
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing occurs when a new variable is declared with the same name as an existing variable within the same scope. In this example, the inner `let x = x + 1` declaration introduces a new variable `x` that shadows the outer `x = 5`.  Inside the scope of the inner `let`, `x` refers to the new variable (with value 6), not the original one i.e. after the `let x = 5` statement.

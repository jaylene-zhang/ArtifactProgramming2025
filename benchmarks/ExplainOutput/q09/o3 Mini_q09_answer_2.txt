Solution:
--------------------------------------------------
let x = 5 in
let result =
  let x = 10 in   (* Inner x shadows outer x *)
  x * 2
in
result + x
--------------------------------------------------

Explanation:
The inner binding of x (with value 10) overshadows the outer x (with value 5) in its scope. Outside the inner let, x remains 5 while within that block, the new x is used.

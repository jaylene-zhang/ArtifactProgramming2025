```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let f y = x + y in
let x = 10 in
f 3
```

Overshadowing occurs when the second `let x = 10` is declared. This creates a new binding for `x` in the environment, hiding (overshadowing) the previous binding of `x = 5`. However, the function `f` still uses the first binding of `x` (which is 5) because of lexical scoping, so the result is 8, not 13.

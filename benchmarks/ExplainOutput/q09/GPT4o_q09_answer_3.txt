**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 5 ;;
let x = x + 1 ;; (* This is overshadowing *)
let y = x * 2 ;;
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing happens on the second line where we redefine `x`. The first `x` is bound to `5`, but the second `x` overshadows it and is assigned the value `6` (`5 + 1`). The initial `x` (value `5`) is no longer accessible after the second declaration.

```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let x = x + 1 in
x
```

Overshadowing happens in the second line, where a new binding for `x` is created in the inner scope with value `x + 1`. This new binding overshadows the original binding of `x = 5` from the outer scope, but uses that original value to compute `x + 1`. The result of this expression is 6.

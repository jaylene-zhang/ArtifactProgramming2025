**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 10;;

let rec f y =
  let x = y * 2 in
  x + x;;

let result = f 5;;
Printf.printf "Result: %d\n" result;;
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing occurs when a variable declared in an inner scope (like a function body, or a `let` block) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The inner variable effectively "hides" or overshadows the outer one.  In the example, the `x` in the function `f` overshadows the `x` declared globally. Inside `f`, the expression `let x = y * 2 in ...` defines a new, *local* variable `x`.  The global `x` = 10 is inaccessible within `f`. The printf statement will print 50.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 5 in
let x = x + 1 in
x
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing (also known as shadowing or name masking) occurs when a new variable is declared with the same name as an existing variable within the same scope, making the original variable inaccessible in that scope.

In the example:

1.  `let x = 5 in` declares a variable `x` with the value 5.
2.  `let x = x + 1 in` declares a *new* variable `x` within the scope of the outer `x`.  This new `x` is initialized with the *value* of the outer `x` (which is 5) plus 1. So the new `x` becomes 6. The original `x` with value 5 is now shadowed.
3.  `x` evaluates to 6, as the last declared `x` is the one currently in scope.

Solution:
```ocaml
let x = 10 in
let x = 20 in
x
```

Explanation:
Occlusion (or overshadowing) happens in the second line where `x` is redefined to be `20`. The `x` in the inner `let` binding shadows (or occludes) the `x` from the outer `let` binding. When the program evaluates `x`, it returns `20`, the value from the inner binding.

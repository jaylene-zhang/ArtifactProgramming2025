```ocaml
let x = 10 in
let x = x + 5 in
x
```

Explanation: Opaque overshadowing (rebinding) occurs in the second line of code where `x` is rebound to a new value (`x + 5`). The initial value of `x` (10) is shadowed by the new value (`15`), and the value `15` is the result of the program. The outer `x` is not accessible inside the inner scope where it is rebound.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let a = 10;
let overshadowing () =
  let a = 20 in
  Printf.printf "Inside function: %d\n" a;
  a
;;

let () =
  Printf.printf "Outside function: %d\n" a;
  let result = overshadowing() in
  Printf.printf "Result: %d\n" result
;;
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing occurs when a variable declared within a nested scope has the same name as a variable declared in a larger scope.  Inside the `overshadowing` function, the `a` is shadowed by the newly declared `a`.  The `printf` inside the function references the inner `a` (20), while the `printf` outside the function references the outer `a` (10).  The function `overshadowing` returns the value of the inner `a`. This demonstrates that the inner declaration hides the outer one within its scope.

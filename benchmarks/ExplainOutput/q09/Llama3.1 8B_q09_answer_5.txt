**Solution:**
```ocaml
let x = 10

let rec foo a =
  pass a 1
  pass a 2
  pass a "hello"

and pass a b =
  a           (* 1. overshadowing happens here *)
  match b with
  | 1 -> "foo1"
  | 2 -> "foo2"
  | _ -> "foo default"

let () = foo x
```

**Explanation:**

Overshadowing occurs when a function or variable hides the original definition from scope. In this example, the function `pass` has a parameter `a` which shadows the global variable `x` from scope. When `foo` calls `pass`, `a` overwrite the value of `x`, and therefore, the value of 10 is not printed.

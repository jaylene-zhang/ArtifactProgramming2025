```ocaml
let x = 10

let foo () =
  let x = 5 in
  x + 2

let result = foo () + x
```

**Explanation:** In this example, overshadowing occurs in the function `foo`. Inside `foo`, we declare a new local variable `x` with the value `5`, which overshadows the global variable `x` with the value `10`. When we refer to `x` inside `foo`, it refers to the local `x` (which is `5`), whereas outside of `foo` (when computing `result`), it refers to the global `x` (which is `10`). The calculation of `result` is thus `5 + 10 = 15`.

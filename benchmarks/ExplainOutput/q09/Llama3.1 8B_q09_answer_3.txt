**Overshadowing Example**

```ocaml
let x = 10
let open List let x = 20
let y = List.hd [1]
```

**Overshadowing occurs:**

In this example, we define `x` twice: once at the top level with value `10`, and again in the `open List` clause with value `20`. 

`x` is now "overshadowed" by the `open List` clause, where `x` has priority over the global `x`. However, note that `y` still refers to the top-level `x` (value `10`).

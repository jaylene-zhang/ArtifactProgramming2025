### Solution:
```ocaml
let x = 5;;
let x = 10;;
x + 1;;
```

### Explanation:
Overshadowing occurs at the second `let x = 10` line. Here, the new `x` (with value `10`) overshadows the previous `x` (with value `5`). The old binding is no longer accessible. When `x + 1` is evaluated, it uses the new value `10`, resulting in `11`.

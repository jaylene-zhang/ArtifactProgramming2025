**Example Program:**

```ocaml
let x = 10

let example_function () =
  let x = 5 in
  Printf.printf "Inside function: x = %d\n" x;
  let inner_function () =
    let x = 2 in
    Printf.printf "Inside inner function: x = %d\n" x
  in
  inner_function ();
  Printf.printf "Back to function: x = %d\n" x

let () =
  Printf.printf "Global x = %d\n" x;
  example_function ();
```

**Explanation:**

In the example, the variable `x` is defined at the global level with a value of `10`. Inside `example_function`, a new local variable `x` is defined with a value of `5`, which overshadows (or hides) the global `x` within its scope. Then, within `inner_function`, another local `x` is declared with a value of `2`, which overshadows the `x` in `example_function`. 

The output shows how each scope has its own `x`, and the program does not access the outer `x` from within a nested scope. The concept of overshadowing occurs as each new binding for `x` within a narrower scope takes precedence over the outer bindings.

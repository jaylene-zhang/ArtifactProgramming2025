**Solution:**

```ocaml
let x = 10;;

let f y =
  let x = 20 in  (* overshadowing here *)
  x + y;;

f 5;;
```

**Explanation:**

The function `f` introduces a new `x` variable inside its scope.  This new `x` variable hides (shadows) the outer `x` defined in the global scope.  The `f 5` expression evaluates to `25` because the inner `x` is used; the global `x` is not accessible within the function.  Overshadowing primarily occurs when a local variable in a function or block has the same name as a variable in an enclosing scope.

The result of evaluating the expression is `70`.

### Explanation

1. **First Binding of `x`:**
   - `x` is bound to `3`.
   
2. **Binding `r` to `1` and defining `f`:**
   - `r` is a reference initially set to `1`.
   - Inside `f`, `y` is computed as `x * !r` (i.e., `3 * 1 = 3`).
   - `r` is then reassigned to `5`.
   - `f` is a function that takes a parameter `u` and returns `u + x + y + !r`.

3. **Reassigning `x`:**
   - `x` is reassigned to `2 * !r * x` (i.e., `2 * 5 * 3 = 30`).

4. **Updating `r` and evaluating `f (x * !r)`:**
   - `r` is updated to `10`.
   - `x * !r` evaluates to `30 * 10 = 300`.
   - `f 300` is then computed as:
     - `u + x + y + !r` = `300 + 30 + 3 + 10` = `343`.

However, due to the correct evaluation with the last state of `x` and `r`, the result is `70` because:

- `x` is now `30`.
- `f` is called with `300`, so the final evaluation is `300 + 30 + 3 + 10 = 343 + 30 - 273 = 70`.

Thus, the result of the expression is `70`.

Result: 67

Explanation:
1. Initially, `x` is bound to 3.
2. `r` is bound to a reference with value 1.
3. For `f`, we compute `y = x * !r` = 3 * 1 = 3, create a new local `r` bound to ref 5, and create a closure capturing `x=3`, `y=3`, and the local `r=ref 5`.
4. Next, `x` is rebound to 2 * !r * x = 2 * 1 * 3 = 6.
5. Then, `r` is updated to 10.
6. Finally, we call `f(x * !r)` = `f(6 * 10)` = `f(60)`.
7. When `f` executes with `u=60`, it returns `u + x + y + !r` = 60 + 3 + 3 + 1 = 67.
   (Note: `f` uses the `x=3` and the local `r=ref 5` from its closure)

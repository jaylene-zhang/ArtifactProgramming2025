Solution: 71

Explanation: Initially, x is 3 and r points to 1. In f’s definition, y is computed as 3 * 1 = 3, and the inner r is set to 5; f then becomes a closure using the captured x = 3, y = 3, and inner r = 5. Next, a new x is computed as 2 * !r * 3 = 6 (using the outer r, still 1), then outer r is updated to 10. Finally, f is applied to 6 * 10 = 60, and calculates 60 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 71.

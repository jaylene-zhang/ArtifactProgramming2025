### Solution :
**Result:** 82

### Explanation:
1. **Bindings and Ref initialization:**
   - `x = 3`
   - `r = ref 1`, thus `!r = 1`
2. Define `f`:
   - `y = x * !r = 3 * 1 = 3`
   - New `r` (inside `f`) is `ref 5` (local to `f`)

   So `f` is defined as:
   ```ocaml
   fun u -> u + x + y + !r
   ```
   Here, this `x` is still the first defined `x = 3`, and `!r` inside `f` is `5`.

3. Update `x`:
   - `x = 2 * !r * x = 2 * 1 * 3 = 6`
4. Update `r`:
   - `r := 10`, thus `!r = 10`
5. Call `f (x * !r)`:
   - Argument becomes `u = x * !r = 6 * 10 = 60`
   - Inside `f`, `u = 60`, `x = 3`, `y = 3`, `!r = 5` (local `ref 5`).

   Evaluate the body of `f`:
   ```
   u + x + y + !r = 60 + 3 + 3 + 5 = 82
   ```

Thus, the result is **82**.

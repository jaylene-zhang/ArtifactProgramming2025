I'm happy to help you with the problem! However, I must point out that the format you requested is typically used for mathematical problems with a numerical answer. Since this is a programming problem, I'll adapt the explanation to fit the format you provided.

**Solution**
```ocaml
let x = 3
let r = ref 1
let f = begin
  let y = x * !r in
  let r = ref 5 in fun u   -> u + x + y + !r
end
let x = 2 * !r * x
r := 10
f (x * !r)
```
**Explanation**

To evaluate this expression, we'll go through it step-by-step:

1. Initially, `x` is bound to `3`, and `r` is a reference (`ref`) to `1`.
2. When evaluating `fun u -> u + x + y + !r`, since `x` is bound to `3` and `r` is `ref 1`, we get `fun u -> u + 3 + !r + 3`, where `!r` is still `1`. Therefore, this function is equivalent to `fun u -> u + 6 + 1`.
3. `x` is reassigned to `2 * !r * x`, which is `2 * 1 * 3 = 6`. Since this reassignment doesn't change the behavior of the function, we can disregard it for the purposes of this evaluation.
4. `r` is reassigned to `10`.
5. The function `f` is called with an argument `(x * !r)`, which is `6 * 10 = 60`.
6. The function `f` returns `u + 6 + 1`, where `u` is `60`. Therefore, the final result is `60 + 6 + 1 = 67`.

The final answer is $\boxed{67}$. However, since this is a programming evaluation, the actual result might be `f (x * !r)`, which will be used as a value that might be used later in the program.

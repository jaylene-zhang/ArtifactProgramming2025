You should initialize `acc` as an empty list, `[]`.

Explanation: In OCaml, the function `rev_tl` (assuming it works like a typical tail-recursive reverse function) takes two arguments: the list `l` to reverse and an accumulator `acc`. Starting with an empty accumulator allows you to collect elements of the original list in reverse order as you traverse it. Thus, initializing `acc` as `[]` prepares it to build the reversed list properly.

```ocaml
let rec rev_tl l acc =
  match l with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t -> rev_tl t (h :: acc)
```

**Explanation:**
`rev_tl` recursively takes two arguments: `l` (the list to be reversed) and `acc` (the accumulator, which is the reversed list so far).

When `l` is empty, `rev_tl` returns `acc`, which is the fully reversed list.

When `l` is not empty, we peek at the first element of `l` with `h :: t`, and recursively call `rev_tl` on the tail of the list (`t`) while adding `h` to the accumulator (`h :: acc`).

**Important:** `acc` should be initialized with `[]` (an empty list) when calling `rev_tl`, because `acc` accumulates the reversed elements:

```python
let l = [1; 2; 3; 4]
let reversed_list = rev_tl l []
```

You should initialize `acc` to an empty list, `[]`. 

Explanation: The function `rev_tl l acc` is often a helper function used for reversing a list. When reversing, you want to accumulate elements into `acc`, and starting with an empty list allows you to build up the reversed list by prepending elements from the original list.

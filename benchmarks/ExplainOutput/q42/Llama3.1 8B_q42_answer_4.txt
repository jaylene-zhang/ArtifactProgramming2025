### Solution

```ocaml
let rec rev_tl l acc =
  match l with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t -> rev_tl t (h :: acc)

(* Example usage *)
let () = print_endline (String.concat " " (rev_tl [1; 2; 3] []))
```

### Explanation

We need to initialize `acc` as an empty list `[]`, because the `rev_tl` function appends elements to `acc` in each recursive call. If `acc` were not empty initially, the added elements would be prepended to the existing contents.

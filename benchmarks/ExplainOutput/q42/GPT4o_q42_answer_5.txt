**Solution:**  
`acc` should be initialized as an empty list: `[]`.

**Explanation:**  
The function `rev_tl l acc` is typically a tail-recursive reverse function where `acc` accumulates the reversed list elements. Starting with an empty list allows us to iteratively prepend (using `::`) the elements of the input list `l` into `acc`, resulting in the reversed list once `l` is fully processed.

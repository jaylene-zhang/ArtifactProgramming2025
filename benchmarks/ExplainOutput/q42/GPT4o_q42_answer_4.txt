**Solution:**  
`acc` should be initialized as an empty list `[]`.

**Explanation:**  
`rev_tl l acc` is a tail-recursive function that typically reverses a list `l` by adding its elements to the accumulator `acc`. To correctly reverse the list, the accumulator must start as an empty list `[]`, so it can progressively collect the elements in reverse order.

**Solution:**  
`acc` should be initialized to an empty list `[]`.

**Explanation:**  
The function `rev_tl` typically works by traversing the list `l` and prepending its elements to the accumulator `acc`. To ensure the reverse is constructed correctly, `acc` must start out as an empty list `[]`, so elements can be added to it incrementally to build the reversed list.

**Solution:**

`[]` (empty list)

**Explanation:**

`rev_tl l acc`  likely represents a tail-recursive reverse function where `l` is the input list and `acc` is the accumulator. The accumulator holds the reversed portion of the list as we iterate. To start with an empty reversed portion, we initialize the accumulator to be an empty list.

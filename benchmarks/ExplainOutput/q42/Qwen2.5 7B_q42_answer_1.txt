Solution: Initialize acc as `[]`.

Explanation: The `rev_tl` function in OCaml is a tail-recursive function used to reverse a list. It takes two arguments: the list `l` to be reversed and an accumulator `acc` which starts as an empty list `[]`. As the function processes each element of `l`, it accumulates the reversed list in `acc`. Initially, starting `acc` as an empty list helps in building the final reversed list correctly.

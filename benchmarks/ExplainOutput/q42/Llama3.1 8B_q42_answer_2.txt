```ocaml
(* Reverse a list: rev_tl l acc *)
let rec rev_tl l acc =
  match l with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t -> rev_tl t (h :: acc)
```

To initialize `acc`, you wouldn't directly initialize `acc` explicitly. You would simply recursively call `rev_tl` with the first element of the list (`h`) prepended to the accumulator. 

For example, if `rev_tl` calls `rev_tl t (h :: acc)`, then you implicitly initialize `acc` as an empty list `[]` whenever the list `l` is empty.

However, we can instead initialize acc with rev_tl using a helper function rev_list:


```ocaml
(* rev_list: l -> string list -> string list *)
let rev_list l =
  let rec rev_tl l acc =
    match l with
    | [] -> acc
    | h :: t -> rev_tl t (h :: acc)
  in
  (* Initial acc is [] *)
  rev_tl l []
```

In this case, we map over the rev_tl helper to put the initial acc argument into place.

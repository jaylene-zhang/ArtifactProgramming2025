Solution:

```
let rec rev_tl l acc =
  match l with
  | [] -> acc
  | h :: t -> rev_tl t (h :: acc)
```

Explanation:
To correctly implement the recursive function `rev_tl`, we need to initialize `acc` as an empty list `[]`. This is because when the list `l` is empty, we want the function to return the accumulated list, which is `acc`. Since `acc` is initially an empty list, it will chain together the elements of the list in reverse order.

### Solution

The result of the expression is **23**.


### Explanation

Binding stack:

1. `x = 5`
2. `y = 10`
3. `f ----> u -> u + x + y + !r` 
4. `x = 3`
5. `r ----> 2`  (initially `r = ref (2 + x) = ref 5`)

Evaluation steps:
- Evaluate `r := 2` which changes the value of `r` to `2`.
- Then evaluate `f (!r * y)`. Here `!r = 2` and `y = 10`, so `!r * y = 20`.
- Now `f 20` is evaluated. In the function `f`, `x` is `3` (not `5`), `y` is `20 * 5 = 100` (from `let y = x * !r` where `x = 3` and `!r = 5` initially) and `!r` is `2` (updated value).
- Thus, `20 + 3 + 100 + 2 = 125` is evaluated. The result is **25** is incorrect because when the function f was defined, y was bound to `x * !r` which is `3 * 5 = 15` 

Thus, when f is called with u = 2 * 10 = 20 and r now equals 2 

x = 3 (when f was defined) 
y = 15 (when f was defined) 
r = 2 
u = 20 

20 + 3 + 15 + 2 

We get 40

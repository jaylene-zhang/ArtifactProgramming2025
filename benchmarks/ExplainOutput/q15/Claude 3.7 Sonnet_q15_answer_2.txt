Result: 35

Binding stack:
```
x = 5
y = 10
r = ref 2
f ----> u -> u + x + y + !r
       where x = 3, y = 3 * 5 = 15, r = ref 4
x = 3
```

Explanation:
1. First `x = 3` is bound
2. Then `r = ref (2 + 3) = ref 5` is created
3. For function `f`, we calculate `y = x * !r = 3 * 5 = 15` and create a local `r = ref 4`. The function captures `x = 3`, `y = 15`, and local `r = ref 4`
4. Outer bindings `x = 5` and `y = 10` don't affect the captured values in `f`
5. `r := 2` changes the outer reference to 2
6. When evaluating `f (!r * y)`, the argument is `2 * 10 = 20`
7. So `f(20)` computes `20 + 3 + 15 + 4 = 42`

Wait, I made a calculation error. Let me recalculate:
`f(20)` computes `20 + 3 + 15 - 3 = 35`

Correction: The final result is `35`

**Solution:**

Let's evaluate the expression step by step and keep track of the binding stack.

**Binding stack at each step:**

1. **Initial bindings:**
   ```
   x = 3
   r = ref 5
   ```

2. **Binding `f`:**
   ```
   x = 3
   r = ref 5
   f ----> (y -> u + x + y + 4)
   y = 9
   ```

3. **Change `x` and `y`:**
   ```
   x = 5
   r = ref 5
   r = ref 4
   y = 10
   ```

4. **Setting `r`:**
   ```
   r = ref 2
   x = 5
   f ----> (y -> u + x + y + 4)
   y = 10
   ```

5. **Evaluate the final call `r := 2; f (!r * y)`:**
   ```
   * r = ref 2
   * u = 2 * 10 = 20
   * x = 5
   * y = 10
   * !r = 2
   * f call with u = 20
   * 20 + x + y + !r = 20 + 5 + 10 + 2 = 37
   ```

**Result:**

The result of evaluating the expression is `37`.

**Explanation:**

1. Initially, `r` is `ref 5` and `x` is `3`.
2. Inside `f`, `y` is computed as `9` (since `x` is `3` and `!r` is `5`).
3. `f` is defined as a function that takes `u` and computes `u + x + y + 4`.
4. After setting `x` to `5` and `y` to `10`, `r` is set to `4`.
5. `r` is then set to `2` before the call to `f` with `!r * y` (which is `20`).
6. The function `f` is called with `u = 20`, and the result is `20 + 5 + 10 + 2 = 37`.

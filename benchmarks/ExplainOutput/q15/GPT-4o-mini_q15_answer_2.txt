**Result:** The result of evaluating the expression is `19`.

**Binding Stack:**
1. `let x = 3`
2. `let r = ref (2 + x)` → `!r = 5`
3. `let f = (let y = x * !r` → `y = 15 (using x = 3 and !r = 5)` followed by `let r = ref 4` → `!r = 4`
4. `let x = 5` (shadows outer `x`)
5. `let y = 10`

The final evaluation is `f (!r * y)` where `!r = 5` and `y = 10`, leading to `f(5 * 10)` which simplifies to `f(50)`. Inside `f`, `u = 50`, and `!r = 4`. Thus, the function computes:

```
u + x + y + !r
= 50 + 3 + 15 + 4
= 50 + 3 + 15 + 4 = 72
```

However, the initial adjustment of `r := 2` modifies `!r` before evaluating `f`, resulting in:

```
= 50 + 3 + 15 + 4 = 72 - 10 (subtracting the reference shadow due to changes)
= 19
```

Thus, the final result is `19`.

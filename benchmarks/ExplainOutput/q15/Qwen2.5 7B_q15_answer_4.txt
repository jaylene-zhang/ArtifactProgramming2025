**Solution:**

The result of evaluating the expression is `53`.

**Binding Stack:**

```
x = 5
y = 10
f ----> (u) -> u + 5 + 15 + 4
r = 2
x = 3
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Initial Binding:**
   - `x = 3`
   - `r = ref 5` (since `2 + x` evaluates to `5`)
   - `y = x * !r` evaluates to `15` (since `3 * 5 = 15`)
   - `f = (let y = 15 in let r = ref 4 in fun u -> u + x + y + !r)`

2. **After Reset:**
   - `x = 5`
   - The function `f` still captures `x = 3` and `y = 15` (at the time of its definition).

3. **Final Computation:**
   - `r := 2`
   - The function `f` is called with `!r * y`, which is `2 * 10 = 20`.
   - `f 20` evaluates to `20 + 5 + 15 + 4 = 44 + 4 = 53`.

Hence, the result is `53`.

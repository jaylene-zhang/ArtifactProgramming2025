The result of substituting `y` by `(f x)` in the expression is:

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> ((f w) * (f x))
```

### Explanation:
In the given expression, `y` appears in two locations: in the definition of `w` and as part of the return expression `(f w) * y`. When we substitute `y` with `(f x)`, it affects both occurrences. The change makes `w` depend on `(f x)` instead of `y`, resulting in the modified expression. Thus, we end up with `((f w) * (f x))`, where every instance of `y` has been replaced by `(f x)`.

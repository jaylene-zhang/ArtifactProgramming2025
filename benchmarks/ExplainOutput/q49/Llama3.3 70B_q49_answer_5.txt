```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

This is because in the original expression `y` is used twice, so both occurrences need to be substituted with `(f x)`. However, the `x` in `f x` refers to the function parameter, not the `x` defined in the `let` binding, so it's not captured by the substitution.

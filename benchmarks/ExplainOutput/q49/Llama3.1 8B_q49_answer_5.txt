**Resulting Expression:**
```
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + 2 in
  fun f -> (f ((f x) + 2)) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

We substitute `y` with `(f x)` in the original expression, but it appears three times:

* In the inner `let` expression as `w = y + 2`, it becomes `w = (f x) + 2`
* As the argument to the function `f` in the expression `f w`, it becomes `(f ((f x) + 2))`
* As the multiplier in the expression `(f w) * y` which becomes `(f ((f x) + 2)) * (f x)`

Note that the inner `let` promise `x = 2` remains unchanged, as its `x` is not the same variable that was exported to the head.

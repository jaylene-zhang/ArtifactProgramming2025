Result after substituting y by (f x):

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation: I replaced each occurrence of y with (f x) in the original expression. The variable y appears twice: once in the definition of w and once in the body of the function. This direct substitution results in the expression shown above.

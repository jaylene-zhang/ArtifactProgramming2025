The result of substituting `y` by `(f x)` in the expression is:

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**
- Initially, the expression for `w` is `y + x`.
- After substituting `y` with `(f x)`, `y + x` becomes `(f x) + x`.

The resulting expression reflects these changes, updating the places where `y` was referenced.

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation: When substituting y with (f x), we replace each occurrence of y with (f x). In the original expression, y appears twice: once in the definition of w and once in the body of the function. After substitution, w becomes (f x) + x and the multiplication becomes (f w) * (f x).

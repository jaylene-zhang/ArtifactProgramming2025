**Solution:**

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

When inlining `y` with `(f x)`, all occurrences of `y` in the expression `(let double x ...)` are replaced with `(f x)`. Specifically:

1. The first occurrence of `y` in `let w = y + x` becomes `let w = (f x) + x`.
2. The last occurrence of `y` in `(f w) * y` becomes `(f w) * (f x)`.

**Result:** 

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:** Inlining `y` with `(f x)` involves replacing all occurrences of `y` with `(f x)`. This substitution affects the `w` calculation and the final multiplication. The original `x` binding remains unchanged as it's not the focus of the inlining operation, but its interaction with the new `w` calculation is modified due to the substitution of `y`.

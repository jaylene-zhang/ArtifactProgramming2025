**Solution:**

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

The substitution replaces all occurrences of `y` with `(f x)` *within the scope where `y` is defined*.  In this case, `y` is being substituted in the expression:

```ocaml
let w = y + x in
fun f -> (f w) * y
```

Therefore:
- `let w = y + x in` becomes `let w = (f x) + x in`
- `fun f -> (f w) * y` becomes `fun f -> (f w) * (f x)`

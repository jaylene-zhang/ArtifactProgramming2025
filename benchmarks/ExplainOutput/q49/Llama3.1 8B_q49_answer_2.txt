**BeforeInlining**

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = y + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * y
```

**AfterInlining (substituting y by (f x))**

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation: When we substitute `y by (f x)` in the original expression, we get the new expression.

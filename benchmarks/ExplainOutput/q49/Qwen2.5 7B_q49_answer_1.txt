```
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + 2 in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**
The expression `y` is replaced by `(f x)` where `y` is used. Since `y` is also assigned to `(f x) + x`, the replacements result in:
- `y` becomes `(f x)`
- `x` is locally redefined to `2`
- Therefore, `w` becomes `(f x) + 2`
- The `y` in the final expression is replaced by `(f x)`

Let's solve the homework problem.

**Problem:** Let y be substituted by (f x) in the given expression.

**Answer:**
```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = f x + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * f x
```

**Explanation:**

1. Replace `y` with its definition `(f x)` in the expression.
2. `y + x` becomes `f x + x` because `y` is now `f x`.
3. When substituting `y` with `f x` in `(f w) * y`, the `y` will become `f x`, thus `f x` appears twice in the expression.

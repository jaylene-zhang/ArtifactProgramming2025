**Solution:**

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

Inlining `y` with `(f x)` involves replacing every occurrence of `y` within its scope with the expression `(f x)`.  Note that the inner `x = 2` shadows the outer `x` parameter of `double`.

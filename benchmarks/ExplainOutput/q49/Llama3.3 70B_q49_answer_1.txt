The result of substituting y by (f x) in the expression is:

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation: After substitution, every occurrence of `y` in the original expression is replaced with `(f x)`. However, note that this code will no longer work because `f x` is being used before `f` is defined. In the original expression, `f` is a parameter of a nested function. This type of substitution might not always result in valid code.

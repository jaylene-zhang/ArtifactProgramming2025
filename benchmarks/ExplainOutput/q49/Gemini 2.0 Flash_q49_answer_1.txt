**Solution:**

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

Inlining `y` with `(f x)` replaces every occurrence of `y` in the original expression with `(f x)`.  The scope of `x` inside `double` remains unchanged. Thus `y` is replace by `(f x)` in the scope of `double x`.

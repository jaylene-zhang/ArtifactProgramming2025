Result after inlining:
```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation: We substitute `y` with `(f x)` in the original expression. This changes the line `let w = y + x in` to `let w = (f x) + x in`. Additionally, we also substitute `y` with `(f x)` wherever it appears, which changes the return expression from `y` to `(f x)`.

**Solution:**

After substituting `y` with `(f x)`, the expression becomes:

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

1. The goal is to replace every instance of `y` with `(f x)` in the body of the original expression.
2. Inside the `double` function's body:
   - `y + x` becomes `(f x) + x`.
   - `y` in `(f w) * y` becomes `(f w) * (f x)`.
3. No other modifications are needed since we are substituting `y` explicitly but maintaining the structure of the original function otherwise.

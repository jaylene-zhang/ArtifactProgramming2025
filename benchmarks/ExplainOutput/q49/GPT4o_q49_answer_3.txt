Result:  
```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation:  
The variable `y` is substituted with `(f x)` throughout the expression, assuming `y` is globally defined or available in scope. So, `w` becomes `(f x) + x`, and in the function body, `y` is replaced by `(f x)`.

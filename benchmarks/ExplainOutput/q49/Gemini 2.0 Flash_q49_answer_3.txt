**Solution:**

```ocaml
let double x =
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**

The `y` is replaced with `(f x)` in the expression.  We simply substitute every occurrence of `y` with `(f x)`. No renaming is necessary since there are no variable capture issues as `y` is not bound within the replaced expression.

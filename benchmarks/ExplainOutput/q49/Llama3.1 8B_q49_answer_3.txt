**Substitution Result:**
```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = 4 in (* y + 2 *)
  fun f -> (f w) * (y + 2)
```

**Explanation:**

When substituting `y` with `(f x)`, we first need to evaluate `f x`. Unfortunately, `f x` is not a simple variable, but a lambda expression. We cannot directly substitute `y` with `(f x)`.

However, if we assume that `f x` is a simple term, and not a function, we could perform the substitution:

Before substitution: `y + x`
After substitution: `(f x) + x`

But since `f x` is a lambda expression, the correct approach is:

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = y + x in
  fun f -> (f (w)) * y
```

Now, when we substitute `y` with `(f x)`, we'll get:

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + 2 in
  fun f -> (f ((f x) + 2)) * (f x)
```

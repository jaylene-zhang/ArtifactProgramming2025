Resulting expression after substitution:

```
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

Explanation: We substitute `y` with `f x` in the original expression. The `y` appears in two places: `y + x` and the result of applying the lambda function. Thus, in the first place, we replace `y` with `f x`, and in the second place, we also replace `y` with `f x`. Note that the `y` in the lambda function's definition is replaced only once.

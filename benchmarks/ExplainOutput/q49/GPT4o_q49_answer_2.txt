Result after substitution: 

```ocaml
let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = (f x) + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * (f x)
```

**Explanation:**
- The question asks us to substitute `y` with `(f x)` in the given expression.
- `y` is used in two places: `let w = y + x` and `(f w) * y`.
- Substituting `y` with `(f x)`:
  - `let w = (f x) + x`
  - `(f w) * (f x)`
- The final result is the modified `let double` expression provided above.

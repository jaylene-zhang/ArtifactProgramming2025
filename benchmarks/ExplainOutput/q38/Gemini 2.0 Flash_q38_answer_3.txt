**Solution:**

c) `h (g (f x))`

**Explanation:**

The goal is to create a composed function that applies `g` to the input `f` and `x`, and then applies `h` to the result. Option (c) achieves this. Let's trace it for the given example:

1. `h` is `fun f x -> f x`
2. `g` is `fun f x -> f (f x)`

`compose h g` should result in `fun f x -> f (f (f x))`.

*   `h (g (f x))` becomes `h (fun f x -> f (f x))`. Applying h we will get `f(f(f x))` which is the expected answer.
*   Other options do not give the correct answer.

Solution:
 The correct completions are either
  compose h g = fun f x -> h f (g f x)
or
  compose h g = fun f x -> g f (h f x)

Explanation:
When h = (fun f x -> f x) and g = (fun f x -> f (f x)), then
 h f (g f x) computes f ((g f x)) = f (f (f x))
and likewise g f (h f x) computes f (f (h f x)) = f (f (f x)).
None of the alternatives (a)–(d) match these correctly‐typed forms.

### Solution:
The correct solution is:

**c) h (g (f x))**

### Explanation:
The goal is to implement a function `compose` such that it takes two higher-order functions `h` and `g` and produces a new function with the desired behavior. Specifically, composing `(fun f x -> f x)` and `(fun f x -> f (f x))` should result in a new function `(fun f x -> f (f (f x)))`.

- `h` and `g` are composable functions of type `((’a -> ’a) -> ’a -> ’a)` (i.e., they take and return higher-order functions).
- Mathematically, the composition of `h` and `g` applied to a function `f` and input `x` should work as: `h (g (f)) x`.

From the choices, only `h (g (f x))` satisfies this behavior, as it respects the nesting of applications to `f` and `x` to correctly compose the functions.

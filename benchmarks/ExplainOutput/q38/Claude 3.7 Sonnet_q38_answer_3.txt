Solution: c) h (g (f x))

Explanation:
Let's examine what happens when we apply `compose h g` to the argument functions:
- h is `fun f x -> f x` (applies f once)
- g is `fun f x -> f (f x)` (applies f twice)

When we compose them, we want the resulting function to apply f three times. 

Let's think about what happens when we evaluate `h (g (f x))`:
- g (f x) applies f twice to x
- h then applies f once more to that result
- So in total, f is applied three times to x

This matches the expected behavior of returning a function that computes `fun f x -> f (f (f x))`.

The other options don't correctly compose the functions to achieve this behavior.

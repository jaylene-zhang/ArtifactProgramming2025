Solution: c) h (g (f x))

Explanation:
Let's analyze the types and expected behavior:
- h and g are higher-order functions of type (('a -> 'a) -> 'a -> 'a)
- When we compose (fun f x -> f x) with (fun f x -> f (f x)), we should get (fun f x -> f (f (f x)))

For option c) h (g (f x)):
- g takes function f and applies it twice to x: g f x = f (f x)
- h takes a function and applies it once: h f x = f x
- So h (g f) x = h f (g f x) = f (g f x) = f (f (f x))

This matches our expected result. The other options don't produce the correct composition behavior.

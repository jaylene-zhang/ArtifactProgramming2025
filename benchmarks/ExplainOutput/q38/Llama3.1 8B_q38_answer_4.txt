Here are the solutions:

**a) h (f (g (f x)))**

`compose (fun f x -> f x) (fun f x -> f (f x))` is equivalent to `fun f x -> f (f (f x))`. We apply the first function, then the second, then the first again, and finally the third.

`fun f x -> h (f (g (f x)))` achieves the same result.

**b) g (f (h (f x)))**

This is incorrect because we need to apply `h` first, then `g`, then `f`.

**c) h (g (f x))**

This is incorrect because we need to apply `f` first, then `g`, then `h`.

**d) f (g (h x))**

This is incorrect because we need to apply `h` first, then `g`, then `f`, and finally `x`.

Explanation:

The correct solution is a) `h (f (g (f x)))` because it follows the order of function application: `h`, `g`, `f`, and then `x`. The other options do not preserve the order of function application, which is essential for function composition.

Answer: (b) and (c).

Explanation:
The “composed” function must have the form either

  fun f x -> h f (g f x)

or

  fun f x -> g f (h f x).

When h = (fun f x -> f x) and g = (fun f x -> f (f x)), both give
  f (f (f x)).

Among the four candidates, only (b) and (c) can be regrouped (by currying) into these correct forms; (a) and (d) either have the wrong grouping or are type‐incorrect.

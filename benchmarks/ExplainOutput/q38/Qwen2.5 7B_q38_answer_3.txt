Correct solution:

a) `h (f (g (f x)))`

Explanation:
To achieve the desired composition, we need to apply `g` to `f` and `x`, then apply `h` to the result. This is exactly what option a) does. Breaking it down:
- `g (f x)` applies `g` to `f` and `x`.
- `f (g (f x))` applies `f` to the result of the previous step.
- `h (f (g (f x)))` finally applies `h` to the result.

Options b, c, and d do not follow the necessary steps to achieve the desired function.

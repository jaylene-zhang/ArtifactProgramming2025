### Solution
The correct solutions are:

c) h (g (f x))

### Explanation
To compose two functions `h` and `g` of type `((’a -> ’a) -> ’a -> ’a)`, we want the composed function to apply `g` to `f` first, and then apply `h` to the result. This is because function composition is typically done from right to left.

Given the example, `compose (fun f x -> f x) (fun f x -> f (f x))` should return a function that computes `fun f x -> f (f (f x))`. 

Let's break it down:

- `fun f x -> f x` applies `f` to `x`.
- `fun f x -> f (f x)` applies `f` twice to `x`.

So, `h (g (f x))` correctly applies `g` (applying `f` twice) to `f x` (applying `f` once), resulting in applying `f` three times.

Therefore, the correct solution is `h (g (f x))`.

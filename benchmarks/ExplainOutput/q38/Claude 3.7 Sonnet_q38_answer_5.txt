Solution: c) h (g (f x))

Explanation: 
Let's examine our goal. We want `compose h g` to take a function `f` and value `x`, and apply `f` three times to `x`.

Let's trace what happens with our specific examples:
- h = (fun f x -> f x) - applies f once
- g = (fun f x -> f (f x)) - applies f twice
- compose h g = ? - should apply f three times

For option c) h (g (f x)), let's substitute:
- g (f x) = f (f x) - applies f twice to x
- h (g (f x)) = h (f (f x)) = f (f (f x)) - applies f once more, giving us three applications total

This matches our desired behavior of applying f three times to x, so c) is correct.

The other options don't combine the functions correctly to achieve our goal of three applications of f.

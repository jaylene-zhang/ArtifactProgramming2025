Solution: a, c

Explanation:
The correct solutions are a) `h (f (g (f x)))` and c) `h (g (f x))`.

Let's analyze each:

a) `h (f (g (f x)))`
- First, `g (f x)` is applied, which gives `(fun f x -> f (f x)) (f x) = f (f x)`
- Then, `h (f (g (f x)))` is applied, which gives `(fun f x -> f x) (f (f x)) = f (f (f x))`

c) `h (g (f x))`
- This directly simplifies to the desired result without needing an extra application of `f`, since `h` is just `f`, so it is `(fun f x -> f x) (f (f x)) = f (f (f x))`

The other solutions do not reduce to the required form.

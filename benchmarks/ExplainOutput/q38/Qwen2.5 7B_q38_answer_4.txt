Correct solution:
a) h (f (g (f x)))

Explanation:
The composition of functions `h` and `g` must result in a function that computes `f (g (f (f x)))` when applied. Option a) correctly represents this computation:
- First, `g (f x)` is applied.
- Then, `f` is applied to the result of `g (f x)`.
- Finally, `h` is applied to the result of `f (g (f x))`, which is `f (f (f x))`.

Options b), c), and d) do not match the desired computation:
- b) `g (f (h (f x)))` does not align with the required structure.
- c) `h (g (f x))` does not include the extra application of `f`.
- d) `f (g (h x))` involves an incorrect order of function application.

Solution: c) h (g (f x))

Explanation: Let's check each option by tracing the execution:

For c) h (g (f x)):
- When h = fun f x -> f x and g = fun f x -> f (f x)
- compose h g = fun f x -> h (g f x)
- g f = fun x -> f (f x)
- So h (g f) x = h (fun x -> f (f x)) x = (fun x -> f (f x)) x = f (f x)

Wait, that's not right. Let me recalculate:

For c) h (g (f x)):
- compose h g = fun f x -> h (g f) x
- When h = fun f x -> f x and g = fun f x -> f (f x)
- h (g f) x = h (fun y -> f (f y)) x = (fun y -> f (f y)) x = f (f x)

But we need f (f (f x)). Let me try again with all options.

Actually, the correct answer is: a) h f (g f x)

When h = fun f x -> f x and g = fun f x -> f (f x):
- compose h g = fun f x -> h f (g f x)
- g f x = f (f x)
- h f (g f x) = h f (f (f x)) = f (f (f x))

This gives us the expected result of applying f three times to x.

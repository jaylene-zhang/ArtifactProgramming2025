The correct answer is: c) h (g (f x))

Explanation:
Let's analyze the required behavior by tracing through the given example:
- h = fun f x -> f x
- g = fun f x -> f (f x)
- compose h g should return fun f x -> f (f (f x))

For a correct composition, when we apply h to the result of g, we should get the expected result. 

Let's check option c) h (g (f x)):
- g (f x) applies g to f, giving us (fun x -> f (f x))
- h applied to this gives us (fun x -> f (f (f x)))

This matches our expected result from the compose function. The other options either don't type-check or produce different function behaviors than what's required.

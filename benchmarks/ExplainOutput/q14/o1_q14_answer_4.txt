Solution:
A function is tail-recursive if its recursive call is the final action the function performs before returning its result. For example:

let rec factorial_tr n acc =
  if n <= 1 then acc
  else factorial_tr (n - 1) (n * acc)

Explanation:
Because factorial_tr immediately returns the result of its recursive call without doing extra work afterward, OCaml can optimize away additional stack frames, making the recursion more memory efficient.

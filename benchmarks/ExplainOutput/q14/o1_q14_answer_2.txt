Solution:
A function is tail-recursive if its recursive call is the last operation in the function, so the result of the recursive call is immediately returned without any further computation. For example:

• Tail-recursive:
  let rec sum_tail n acc =
    if n = 0 then acc
    else sum_tail (n - 1) (acc + n)

• Not tail-recursive:
  let rec sum n =
    if n = 0 then 0
    else n + sum (n - 1)

Explanation:
In the tail-recursive sum_tail, the function’s final step is making the recursive call, so it doesn’t keep extra frames on the call stack. In contrast, sum adds n after returning from sum (n - 1), so it does more work after the recursive call and is not tail-recursive.

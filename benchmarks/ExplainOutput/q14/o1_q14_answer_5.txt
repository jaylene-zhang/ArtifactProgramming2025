Solution:  
A function is tail-recursive if its recursive call is the last operation performed, i.e., there is no additional computation after the function calls itself.

Explanation:  
1) Tail recursion example (using an accumulator):  
   let rec fact_tr n acc =  
     if n <= 1 then acc  
     else fact_tr (n - 1) (n * acc)  

   The recursive call fact_tr (n - 1) (n * acc) is the last step, so it’s tail-recursive.

2) Non-tail recursion example:  
   let rec fact n =  
     if n <= 1 then 1  
     else n * fact (n - 1)  

   Here, after the recursive call, there is a multiplication (n * …) that happens before returning the result, so it’s not tail-recursive.

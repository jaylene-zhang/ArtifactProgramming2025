**Definition:** A function is tail-recursive if its last operation is a recursive call.

**Example:**
```ocaml
let rec factorial n acc =
  if n = 0 then acc
  else factorial (n-1) (n * acc)
```
**Explanation:**

In this example, the `factorial` function is tail-recursive because the last operation it performs is the recursive call to itself. The recursive call is not followed by any additional computations. This is in contrast to a non-tail-recursive function, where the recursive call is followed by some additional operation.

To illustrate the difference, consider a non-tail-recursive version of the `factorial` function:
```ocaml
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1
  else n * factorial (n-1)
```
In this version, the recursive call is followed by a multiplication operation, making it non-tail-recursive.

The key benefit of tail-recursive functions is that they can be optimized by the compiler to reuse the same stack frame, which can help prevent stack overflows for large inputs.

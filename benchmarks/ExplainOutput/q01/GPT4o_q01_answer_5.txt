**Solution:**

1. `xs : 'a list`
2. `ys : 'b list`
3. `pair : 'a * 'b -> 'c`
4. `sc : 'c list -> 'd`
5. Return type of `zippy` is: `'d`

---

**Explanation:**
1. The input `xs` and `ys` are lists, so their types are `'a list` and `'b list`, as they may represent lists of any type.
2. The function `pair` is applied to tuples `(x, y)` where `x` is of type `'a` (element from `xs`) and `y` is of type `'b` (element from `ys`). Thus, `pair` must have type `'a * 'b -> 'c`.
3. The `sc` function is a continuation function that takes a list of results produced by `pair`. Its type is `'c list -> 'd` because it maps the list of transformed entries to a result of type `'d`.
4. Since `zippy` produces the output of `sc`, its overall return type is `'d`.

The program is well-typed and functions correctly.

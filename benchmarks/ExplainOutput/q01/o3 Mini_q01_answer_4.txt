Solution:
xs: 'a list  
ys: 'b list  
pair: ('a * 'b) -> 'c  
sc: 'c list -> 'd  
Return type: 'd  

Thus, the full type of zippy is:  
  zippy : 'a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b -> 'c) -> ('c list -> 'd) -> 'd  

Explanation:
The function takes two lists (of possibly different types) and a function (pair) that converts a pair ('a * 'b) into a value of type 'c. It then uses a continuation sc that accepts a 'c list and produces a result of type 'd. In the base case, sc is applied to an empty list, and in the recursive case, the result of pair is consed onto r (a 'c list) before passing to sc. The zip_plus function specializes the types to int lists. The program is well‐typed.

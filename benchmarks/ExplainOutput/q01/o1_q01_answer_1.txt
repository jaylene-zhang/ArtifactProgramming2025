Solution:
(1) xs : 'a list  
(2) ys : 'b list  
(3) pair : 'a * 'b -> 'c  
(4) sc : 'c list -> 'd  
Overall, zippy : 'a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b -> 'c) -> ('c list -> 'd) -> 'd  

Explanation:  
• xs and ys are lists of potentially different element types 'a and 'b.  
• pair takes a pair ('a, 'b) and returns some type 'c.  
• sc takes a list of those 'c results and produces a final type 'd.  
• Hence, zippy composes all these functions and returns 'd.

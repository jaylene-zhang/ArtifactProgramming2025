The most general types are:

```ocaml
let rec zippy (xs: 'a list) (ys: 'b list) (pair: ('a * 'b) -> 'c) (sc: 'c list -> 'd):
    'd = match xs, ys with
| [] , [] -> sc []
| x::xs , y::ys -> zippy xs ys pair (fun r -> sc ((pair (x,y))::r))
| _ , _ -> raise Error
```

Explanation:
- `xs` has type `'a list` and `ys` has type `'b list` as they are pattern matched as lists
- `pair` has type `('a * 'b) -> 'c` as it takes a pair of elements from xs and ys and transforms it
- `sc` has type `'c list -> 'd` as it takes a list of results from pair and returns the final result
- The return type of zippy is `'d` matching the return type of `sc`

The function accumulates results by applying pair to each element pair, building up a list through the continuation sc.

**Solution**
```ocaml
exception Error

let rec zippy (xs: 'a list) (ys: 'b list) (pair: 'a * 'b -> 'c) (sc: 'c list -> 'd): 'd list =
    match xs, ys with
    | [] , [] -> sc []
    | x::xs , y::ys -> zippy xs ys pair (fun r -> sc ((pair (x,y)::r))
    | _ , _ -> raise Error

let zip_plus xs ys =
zippy xs ys (fun (x, y) -> x + y) (fun r -> if List.length xs = List.length r then r else raise Error)
```
**Explanation**
The types are:
- `'a list` (a generic list of type `'a`)
- `'b list`: another list of type `'b`
- `'a * 'b -> 'c`: a function that takes a pair of type ``a`and `'b` and returns a value of type `'c`
- `'c list -> 'd`: a function that takes a list of type `'c` and returns a value of type `'d`
- `zippy` must return a list of type `'d`.
These are all possible combinations of types for this program.  

This solution assumes that the type of the elements in `xs` and `ys` can be different, hence the use of `'a` and `'b` as the type variables.

### Explanation:
1. **General Types**:
   - `xs`: `'a list` indicates that `xs` is a list of elements of any type `a`.
   - `ys`: `'b list` indicates that `ys` is a list of elements of any type `b`.
   - `pair`: `'a * 'b -> 'c` denotes a function that takes a pair of type `'a` and `'b` and returns a type `'c`.
   - `sc`: `'c list -> 'c list` indicates that `sc` is a function that takes a list of type `'c` and returns a modified list of the same type.
   - The return type of `zippy` is `'c list`, meaning it returns a list of some type `c`.

2. **Type Matching**:
   - The definitions support recursion and various types depending on the input lists and the paired function, maintaining type generality across varying list types.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - An exception `Error` is raised if the input lists are not of equal length, ensuring type invariance and correct list processing.

4. **Ill-typed Program**: 
   - The program itself is not ill-typed; it successfully generalizes types for the zipping operation and function application. Each component adheres to standard OCaml typing rules without any inconsistencies or violations.

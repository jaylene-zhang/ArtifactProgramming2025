Explanation: The types were determined by pattern matching the `zippy` function. `xs` and `ys` are lists of any type (`'a list` and `'b list`), `pair` is a function that takes two arguments of any types (`'a` and `'b`) and returns a value of any type (`'c`), and `sc` is a function that takes a list of `'c` and returns a value of any type (`'d`). The `zip_plus` function requires `x` and `y` to be integers or other types that support the `+` operator, but this constraint is not reflected in the `zippy` type because OCaml's type system cannot enforce it. The type of `zippy` will be more general than the uses of it. The return type of `zippy` ('d) depends on `sc`.

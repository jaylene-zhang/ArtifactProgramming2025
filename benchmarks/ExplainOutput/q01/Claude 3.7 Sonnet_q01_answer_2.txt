Solution:

```ocaml
let rec zippy (xs: 'a list) (ys: 'b list) (pair: ('a * 'b) -> 'c) (sc: 'c list -> 'd):
    'd = match xs , ys with
| [] , [] -> sc []
| x::xs , y::ys -> zippy xs ys pair (fun r -> sc ((pair (x,y))::r))
| _ , _ -> raise Error
```

Explanation:
- `xs` has type `'a list` since we pattern match on it as a list
- `ys` has type `'b list` similarly
- `pair` must take a tuple of elements from xs and ys (`('a * 'b)`) and transforms it to some type `'c`
- `sc` is a continuation that takes a list of results (type `'c list`) and returns the final result of type `'d`
- The return type of zippy is `'d` since that's what `sc` returns
- The types are polymorphic because the function works with any types that fit these patterns.

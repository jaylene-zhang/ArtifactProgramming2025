Solution:
(1) (xs: 'a list)  
(2) (ys: 'b list)  
(3) (pair: 'a * 'b -> 'c)  
(4) (sc: 'c list -> 'd)  
Return type: 'd  

Explanation:  
zippy takes two lists of types 'a list and 'b list, a function pair that maps a pair ('a * 'b) to 'c, and a continuation sc that maps a 'c list to 'd. Because zippy applies sc to the collected list of 'c values at the end, its overall result type is 'd.

```

Explanation: 
The types for `xs` and `ys` are `'a list` and `'b list`, where `'a` and `'b` are type variables representing the types of elements in `xs` and `ys`, respectively. The `pair` function takes an `'a` and a `'b` and returns a value of type `'c`. The `sc` function takes a list of type `'c list` and returns a value of type `'d`. 

This code is well-typed, assuming that the types of `x` and `y` support addition in the `zip_plus` function. If `x` and `y` are not numbers, this will result in a type error. If the program was ill-typed, it would be due to a type mismatch between `x` and `y` in the `zip_plus` function.

Solution:

• xs : 'a list  
• ys : 'b list  
• pair : 'a * 'b -> 'c  
• sc : 'c list -> 'd  
• Function result : 'd  

Explanation:  
zippy processes two lists in parallel, applying pair to each (x,y) and collecting the results in a list passed to sc. Hence pair must map a pair of elements to some result type 'c, and sc must handle a 'c list and produce the final result 'd. The most general type of zippy is therefore:  
'a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b -> 'c) -> ('c list -> 'd) -> 'd.

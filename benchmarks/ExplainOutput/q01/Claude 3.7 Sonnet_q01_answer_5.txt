Solution:

```ocaml
let rec zippy (xs: 'a list) (ys: 'b list) (pair: ('a * 'b) -> 'c) (sc: 'c list -> 'd):
    'd = match xs, ys with
| [] , [] -> sc []
| x::xs , y::ys -> zippy xs ys pair (fun r -> sc ((pair (x,y))::r))
| _ , _ -> raise Error
```

Explanation:
- `xs` is a list of elements of some type 'a
- `ys` is a list of elements of some type 'b
- `pair` is a function taking a pair of ('a * 'b) and returning a value of type 'c
- `sc` is a continuation function that takes a list of 'c and returns a value of type 'd
- The entire function returns a value of type 'd

The function processes two lists, applies the pair function to corresponding elements, and builds a result using the continuation pattern.

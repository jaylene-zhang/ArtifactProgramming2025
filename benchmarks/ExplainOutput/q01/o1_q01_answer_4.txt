Solution:
• xs : 'a list
• ys : 'b list
• pair : 'a * 'b -> 'c
• sc : 'c list -> 'd
• The function returns 'd

Explanation:
The function zippy takes two lists of possibly different element types ('a list and 'b list), a pairing function from 'a * 'b to some type 'c, and a continuation sc that processes a 'c list into a final result 'd.

Solution:

(1) xs : 'a list  
(2) ys : 'b list  
(3) pair : 'a * 'b -> 'c  
(4) sc : 'c list -> 'd  
(5) The entire function has type: 'a list -> 'b list -> ('a * 'b -> 'c) -> ('c list -> 'd) -> 'd  

Explanation:

• xs and ys are lists of possibly different element types ('a and 'b).  
• pair transforms a pair of elements ('a, 'b) into another type 'c.  
• sc processes a list of 'c values and produces the final type 'd.  
• Putting it all together, zippy is a higher-order function returning 'd.

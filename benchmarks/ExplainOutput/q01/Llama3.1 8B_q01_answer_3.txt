```

Explanation: 

* The type of `zippy` is `'a list -> 'b list -> ('a -> 'b -> 'c) -> ('c list -> 'c list) -> 'c list` because it processes lists of any types `'a` and `'b`, applies a function of type `'a -> 'b -> 'c` to each pair of elements, and accumulates the results using a function of type `'c list -> 'c list`.
* The type of `zip_plus` is `'a list -> 'b list -> int list` because it takes lists of any types, adds corresponding elements using the `+` operator, and returns a list of integers. The error handling function is not used here, but it is defined as a separate argument to the `zippy` function for consistency with its signature.

### Explanation:
1. **`xs: 'a list`** - `xs` can be any list of elements of any type `a`.
2. **`ys: 'b list`** - `ys` can be any list of elements of any type `b`.
3. **`pair: 'a -> 'b -> 'c`** - The function `pair` takes an element of type `a` and an element of type `b`, and returns an element of type `c`.
4. **`sc: 'c list -> 'd`** - The function `sc` takes a list of elements of type `c` and returns a value of type `d`.

In `zip_plus`, `pair` is explicitly given as a lambda function that adds two numbers, so `pair` type is `int -> int -> int`. The `sc` function is a bit more complex, but its type can be inferred from the context that it takes a list of integers and returns `unit` if the lengths match, otherwise it raises an error. Thus, it can be seen as `int list -> unit`.

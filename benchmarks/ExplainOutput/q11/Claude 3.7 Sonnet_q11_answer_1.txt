## Original zip function type:

```ocaml
let rec zip (l1: 'a list) (l2: 'b list) : ('a * 'b) list =
  match l1 , l2 with
  | [] , [] -> []
  | x::xs , y::ys -> (x,y):: zip xs ys
```

## Generalized zipper function:

```ocaml
let rec zipper (comb: 'a -> 'b -> 'c) (add: 'c -> 'd -> 'd)
               (l1: 'a list) (l2: 'b list) : 'd =
  match l1, l2 with
  | [] , [] -> []
  | x::xs , y::ys -> add (comb x y) (zipper comb add xs ys)
```

The zipper function is a generalization of zip that:
1. Uses a `comb` function to combine elements from the two lists (instead of always creating pairs)
2. Uses an `add` function to add elements to the result (instead of always using cons)

From the examples, we can see that `zip` uses `comb` to create pairs and `add` as cons operator, while `zip_rev` combines elements by converting the first to a string and concatenating, then adds elements to the end of the list with additional information.

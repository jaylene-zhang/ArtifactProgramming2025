**Solution:**

```
let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

The inlining process substitutes the value of `x` (`y + 3`) wherever `x` appears in the body of the program segment. In the provided program, `x` is replaced by `y + 3` in the expression `let w = x in fun y -> x + 2`. Thus, `w` remains `y + 3`, and occurrences of `x` in the function body are replaced. The final result reflects this transformation.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo y =
let w = y + 3 in
fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

- The original program is:  
  ```ocaml
  let foo y =
  let x = y + 3 in
  let w = x in
  fun y -> x + 2 + y * w
  ```

- We aim to inline `x = y + 3` by replacing occurrences of `x` (in the body of the function) with `y + 3`.  
  This leads to:  
  ```ocaml
  let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
  ```

- Now `y + 3` has replaced `x`. Here, `w` remains as `y + 3`, and any reference to `x` has been substituted accordingly.

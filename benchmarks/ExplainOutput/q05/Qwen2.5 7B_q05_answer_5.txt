Resulting program:
```ocaml
let foo y =
let w = y + 3 in
fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

Explanation:
- We replaced `x` with `y + 3` wherever it appears in the lambda function.
- The original `x` was defined as `y + 3`, so all instances of `x` are now replaced with `y + 3`.
- This simplifies the lambda function directly, making the program more efficient by avoiding the need to compute `x` during the lambda's execution.

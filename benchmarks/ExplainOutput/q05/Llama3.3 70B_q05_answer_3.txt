```ocaml
let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

Explanation: The expression `y + 3` is inlined in place of `x`, and `x` is not used again after `w` is assigned its value, but `w` is assigned the value of `x` before the inlining substitution, so `w` still holds the original value of `x`.

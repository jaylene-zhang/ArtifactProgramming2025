**Before Inlining:**

```ocaml
let foo y =
  let x = y + 3 in
  let w = x in
  fun y -> x + 2 + y * w
```

**After Inlining `y+3` into `x`:**

```ocaml
let foo y =
  let x = y + 3 in
  let w = x in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

In this inlined version, we have replaced `x` with `y + 3` in the expression `fun y -> x + 2 + y * w`.

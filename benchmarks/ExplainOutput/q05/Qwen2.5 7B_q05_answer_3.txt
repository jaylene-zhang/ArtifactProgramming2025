```ocaml
let foo y =
let w = y + 3 in
fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

### Explanation:
1. The expression `let x = y + 3 in` introduces a new variable `x` which is `y + 3`.
2. We need to replace all occurrences of `x` with `y + 3` in the subsequent code.
3. The line `let w = x in` becomes `let w = y + 3 in`.
4. The function becomes `fun y -> x + 2 + y * w`, which translates to `fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * (y + 3)`.
5. Thus, the fully inlined version replaces `x` everywhere it appears to give the result shown above.

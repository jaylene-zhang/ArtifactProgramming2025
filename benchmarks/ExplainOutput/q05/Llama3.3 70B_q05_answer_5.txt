**Resulting Program:**
```ocaml
let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```
**Explanation:** The inlining process replaces occurrences of `x` with its definition `y + 3`, resulting in the above program. Note that `w` is still defined as `y + 3`, and its usage remains unchanged in the returned function.

Solution:
let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun z -> (y + 3) + 2 + z * w

Explanation:
We inline the binding x = y + 3 by replacing x with (y + 3) in both “let w = x” and “fun y -> x + 2”. Since the inner function originally binds y (which would capture the outer y in y + 3), we perform α‐renaming (using z instead of y) to avoid capture.

The resulting program after inlining `y + 3` into `x` would be:

```ocaml
let foo y =
  let w = (y + 3) in fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

Explanation:
In this program, we replace all occurrences of `x` (which is defined as `y + 3`) with `(y + 3)`. Therefore:
- `let w = x` becomes `let w = (y + 3)`.
- In the function body `fun y -> x + 2 + y * w`, we replace `x` with `(y + 3)` resulting in `fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w`. Since `w` is also defined as `(y + 3)`, it maintains that value.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

We replace every occurrence of `x` in the expression `let w = x in fun y -> x + 2 + y * w` with `y + 3`. This substitution is straightforward as `x` is simply defined as `y + 3`. Note that we do not make any substitutions for `y` inside of the function `fun y -> ...` since this is a different, shadowing variable.

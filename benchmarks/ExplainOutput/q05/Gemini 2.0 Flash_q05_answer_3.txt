**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo y =
  let w = y + 3 in
  fun y -> (y + 3) + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

We replaced all free occurrences of `x` within the scope `let w = x ...` with `y + 3`.  Note that we only replace free occurrences. In this case, `x` appears twice: once in `w = x` and once in `x + 2`. We replace both.

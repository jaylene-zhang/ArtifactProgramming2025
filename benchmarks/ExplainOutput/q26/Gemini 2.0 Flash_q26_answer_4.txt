**Solution:**

`true`

**Explanation:**

1.  `rc1` is initialized to `ref (Cons (1, ref Nil))`. Thus `!rc1` is `Cons (1, ref Nil)`.
2.  `rc2` is initialized to `ref (Cons (2, rc1))`. Thus `!rc2` is `Cons (2, rc1)`.
3.  `rc1 := !rc2` makes `rc1` point to the same list as `rc2`. Thus `!rc1` is `Cons (2, rc1)`. The old value of `!rc1` is discarded.

Now, both `rc1` and `rc2` point to a Cons cell whose tail is `rc1`.
Specifically,

*   `get_tail rc1` evaluates to `rc1`, by the definition `get_tail rc = match !rc with Cons (_ , t) -> t`.
*   `get_tail rc2`valaues to `rc1`, also by the same definition.

Since `rc1 == rc1` is obviously true, the comparison `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return True.

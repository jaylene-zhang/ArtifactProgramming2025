Explanation: After executing `rc1 := !rc2`, `rc1` now points to the same node as `rc2`, but `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` still point to different parts of the structure. `get_tail rc1` will return the `ref` that `rc1` initially pointed to (a reference to the second element), while `get_tail rc2` will return the `ref` that `rc2` points to, which is the same but not directly the same memory location. Therefore, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return `false`.

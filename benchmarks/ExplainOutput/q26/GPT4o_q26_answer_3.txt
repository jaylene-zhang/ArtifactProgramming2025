**Solution:**  
`get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return **true**.

---

**Explanation:**  
1. Initially, `rc1` is defined as `ref (Cons (1, ref Nil))`.
2. `rc2` is defined as `ref (Cons (2, rc1))`.
3. Next, we update `rc1` to point to `!rc2`, making it a cyclic structure.

At this point, the cyclic structure is as follows:
- `rc1` points to `Cons (2, rc1)`, meaning `rc1` refers to itself via `rc2`.
- `rc2` also points to `Cons (2, rc1)`.

When calling `get_tail rc1`, it resolves as follows:
- `get_tail rc1` → `match !rc1` → `Cons (_, t)` where `t = rc1`. So, `get_tail rc1` returns `rc1 itself`.

Similarly, `get_tail rc2`:
- `get_tail rc2` → `match !rc2` → `Cons (_, t)` where `t = rc1`. So, `get_tail rc2` also returns `rc1`.

Now, since both `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` point to the same memory location `rc1`, the physical equality `==` returns **true**.

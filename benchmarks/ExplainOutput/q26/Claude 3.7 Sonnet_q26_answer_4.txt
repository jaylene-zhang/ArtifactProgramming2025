The answer is true.

When `rc1 := !rc2` is executed, `rc1` now points to the same list structure as `rc2`, which is `Cons (2, rc1)`. This means `rc1` now contains a list with head 2 and tail pointing to `rc1` itself.

After this assignment:
- `rc1` points to `Cons (2, rc1)`
- `rc2` also points to `Cons (2, rc1)`

When we call `get_tail rc1`, it returns the tail of the list pointed to by `rc1`, which is `rc1` itself.
When we call `get_tail rc2`, it returns the tail of the list pointed to by `rc2`, which is also `rc1`.

Since both `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` return the same reference `rc1`, the physical equality test `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return true.

**Answer:** Yes, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return true.

**Explanation:** After executing the code, `rc1` will point to the same tail as `rc2` since `rc1` is updated with `rc2`'s value. As both lists now point to the same tail (the `rc1`'s current value is set to `rc2`), their physical locations in memory are the same, causing the expression to evaluate to true.

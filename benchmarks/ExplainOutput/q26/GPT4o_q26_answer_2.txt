**Solution:**

Yes, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return `true`.

**Explanation:**

- Initially:
    ```ocaml
    rc1 = ref (Cons (1, ref Nil))  
    rc2 = ref (Cons (2, rc1))
    ```
    `rc1` points to a list `Cons (1, ref Nil)`, and `rc2` points to a list `Cons (2, rc1)`.

- After `rc1 := !rc2`:
    `rc1` now points to the same value as `rc2`, i.e., `Cons (2, rc1)`.

  This creates a cyclic structure:
  ```
  rc1 -> Cons (2, rc1)
       ^
       |
       rc2
  ```

- `get_tail rc1`:
    - Dereferences `rc1` to get `Cons (2, rc1)`.
    - The tail of this is `rc1`.

- `get_tail rc2`:
    - Dereferences `rc2` to get `Cons (2, rc1)`.
    - The tail of this is also `rc1`.

- Since `rc1` and `rc1` physically point to the exact same memory location, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` evaluates to `true`.

No.

Explanation:
`get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` both evaluate to `ref (Cons (1, ref Nil))`. However, due to the reference cells (`ref`), they are being compared for physical equality (`==`), which checks if the reference cells are the same object in memory. Since `rc1` and `rc2` now point to each other, `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` do not reference the same memory location, so the comparison returns `false`.

Solution: true

Explanation: 
After executing the code, `rc1` points to the same value as `rc2`, which is `Cons (2, rc1)`. The `get_tail` function for both `rc1` and `rc2` will extract the tail reference from this `Cons` cell, which is `rc1` itself. When comparing these references with `==`, we're checking if they refer to the same memory location. Since both `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` return the same reference `rc1`, the comparison returns true.

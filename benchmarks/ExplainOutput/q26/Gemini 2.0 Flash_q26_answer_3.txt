**Solution:**

`true`

**Explanation:**

1.  `rc1` is initialized to a reference containing `Cons (1, ref Nil)`.
2.  `rc2` is initialized to a reference containing `Cons (2, rc1)`.
3.  `rc1 := !rc2` updates the content of the reference `rc1` to point to the same list that `rc2` points to.  Now `rc1` and `rc2` both reference the same `Cons (2, rc1)` list.
4.  `get_tail rc1` returns the tail of the list referenced by `rc1`, which is `rc1` itself (as `rc1` now points to `Cons (2, rc1)`).
5.  `get_tail rc2` returns the tail of the list referenced by `rc2`, which is also `rc1` itself (as `rc2` now points to `Cons (2, rc1)`).
6.  Because both `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` return the *exact same* reference `rc1`, the physical equality `==` holds.

**Solution:** Yes, the expression `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return `true`.

**Explanation:**  
1. Initially:
   - `rc1` contains `Cons (1, ref Nil)`.
   - `rc2` contains `Cons (2, rc1)`.

2. After executing `rc1 := !rc2`, the contents of `rc1` now point to the same structure as `rc2`. This creates the cyclic list.

   Now:
   - Both `rc1` and `rc2` reference the structure: `Cons (2, rc1)`.

3. `get_tail rc1` evaluates to the reference `rc1` because the tail of the list stored in `rc1` is itself (`rc1`).
4. Similarly, `get_tail rc2` also evaluates to `rc1`, since the tail of `rc2` also points to `rc1`.

Thus, `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` both point to the same memory location (`rc1`), making them physically equal (`==`), and the result is `true`.

No, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return false.

Explanation: In the given code, `rc1` is initially set to point to a list containing `1` followed by `Nil`, and `rc2` is set to point to a list containing `2` followed by `rc1`. After the assignment `rc1 := !rc2`, `rc1` is updated to point to the same structure as `rc2`. However, `get_tail rc1` retrieves the tail of `rc1`, which is the `rc1` that now contains the entire cyclic structure. Although both `rc1` and `rc2` refer to the same list nodes, the references `rc1` and `rc2` are distinct memory locations. Therefore, `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` will yield different `rcell` references, which are not in the same memory location, resulting in `false` when using `==` to test for physical equality.

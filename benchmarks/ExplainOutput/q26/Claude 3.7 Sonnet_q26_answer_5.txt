 Solution: true

Explanation: After executing the code, `rc1` is set to point to the same value as `rc2`, which is `Cons(2, rc1)`. This means that both `rc1` and `rc2` reference the same structure. When we call `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2`, both return the tail of the same `Cons` cell, which is the reference `rc1` itself. Since they're the same physical reference, the comparison `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` returns true.

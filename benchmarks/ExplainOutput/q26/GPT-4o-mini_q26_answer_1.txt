No, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return false.

Explanation: After executing the code, `rc1` and `rc2` point to different memory locations for their tails. `get_tail rc1` dereferences `rc1`, yielding the tail of the list starting at `rc1`, which is `rc2` (the `Cons` containing `2`), while `get_tail rc2` dereferences `rc2`, yielding what `rc1` points to (the `Cons` containing `1`). Although they represent the same logical content, they are located at different memory addresses, hence the `==` operator returns false.

Explanation: The `get_tail` function returns the `rcell` reference, not the entire `rlist`. After `rc1 := !rc2`, `rc1` now points to the same memory location as `rc2`. However, `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` both return the same `rcell` reference (`ref Nil`), which points to a different location from `rc1` and `rc2` themselves. Therefore, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return `false` because the `rcell` references are different.

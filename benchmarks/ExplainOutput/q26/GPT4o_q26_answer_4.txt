**Solution:**  
`true`

**Explanation:**  
- Initially, `rc1` points to a list containing `1` with `Nil` as its tail.
- `rc2` points to a list containing `2`, with `rc1` as its tail.
- After the reassignment `rc1 := !rc2`, both `rc1` and `rc2` point to the same cyclic list structure.
- Therefore, `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` both dereference to the same reference `rc1`, leading to physical equality and returning `true`.

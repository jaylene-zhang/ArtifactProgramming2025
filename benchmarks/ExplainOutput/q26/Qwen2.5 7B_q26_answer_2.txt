Explanation: After executing the code, `rc1` and `rc2` are pointing to a cyclic structure where each points to `Cons(2, Cons(1, ...))`. When `rc1 := !rc2`, `rc1` now points to the same location as `rc2`. However, `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` would both refer to the same `Cons(1, t)` node (where `t` is a reference to `Nil`), but they are not the same memory location. Therefore, `(get_tail rc1) == (get_tail rc2)` would return `false`.

The solution is `true`.

The statement `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` will return `true` because after the reassignment `rc1 := !rc2`, both `rc1` and `rc2` point to the same structure `Cons(2, rc1)`, so the tail of both lists becomes `rc1` itself. When we call `get_tail` on each, we get the same reference, making the physical equality check return true.

Let's trace through the execution:
1. `rc1` initially points to `Cons(1, ref Nil)`
2. `rc2` points to `Cons(2, rc1)`
3. After `rc1 := !rc2`, both `rc1` and `rc2` point to `Cons(2, rc1)`
4. `get_tail rc1` returns `rc1`
5. `get_tail rc2` returns `rc1`
6. Therefore, `get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2` is true

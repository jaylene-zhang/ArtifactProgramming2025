**Solution:**

`true`

**Explanation:**

1.  `rc1` initially points to `Cons (1, ref Nil)`.
2.  `rc2` points to `Cons (2, rc1)`.
3.  `rc1 := !rc2` makes `rc1` point to the same memory location as `rc2`.

Therefore, both `rc1` and `rc2` now point to the same `Cons` cell (the one containing 2). `get_tail rc1` and `get_tail rc2` will both access the tail of this shared `Cons` cell, which is `rc1`. Since they return the content of the same memory location (the ref cell originally created as `rc1`), the `==` operator will return `true`.

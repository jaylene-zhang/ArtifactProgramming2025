## Solution

```ocaml
let f = function
  | []   -> []
  | h :: [] -> [h]
  | _   -> rotate (List.tl (List.rev l))
```

## Explanation

This function creates a copy of the original list, reverses it, takes the second-to-last element, and rotates the rest to the front. However, there's a syntax error in the given code. The option `let rec f l =` should be replaced with a pattern match instead.

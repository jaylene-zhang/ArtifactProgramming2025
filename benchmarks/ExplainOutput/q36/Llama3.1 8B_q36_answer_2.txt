**Solution:**
```
let f l = match l with
  | [] -> []
  | h :: t -> rotate (t @ [h])
```
Rotates the input list **twice**, effectively cycling each element 3 positions to the right.

**Explanation:** The function takes a list `l` as input. When the list has at least five elements, it appends the first element to the end of the rest of the list (`t @ [h]`), and then applies the `rotate` function to the resulting list. The `rotate` function removes the first element and moves it to the end, so applying it twice does the equivalent of rotating the original list by 3 positions to the right.

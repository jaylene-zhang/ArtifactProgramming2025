**Function f Implementation:**

```ocaml
let rec f l =
  match l with
  | []   -> []
  | h :: t   -> f (rotate (t @ [h]))
```
However, it seems more accurate to say that your code was trying to recursively call itself but forgot to recursively call itself with the result of `rotate (t @ [h])`. Here's the corrected explanation of the original implementation without a recursive call.

**Original Function f Implementation with Explanation:**

```ocaml
let rec f l =
  match l with
  | []   -> []
  | h :: t   -> rotate (t @ [h])
```

**Explanation:** 
This function "rotates" the list by one position twice. It first creates a new list where the first element is moved to the end (`t @ [h]`). Then it applies another rotation operation to this new list, effectively moving the second element of the original list to the end. For lists with at least five elements, it moves the second element to the end of the list.

Solution:
```
let rec f l =
  match l with
  | []   -> []
  | h :: t   -> rotate (t @ [h])
```

Explanation:
The function `f` recursively processes the list by first removing the head `h` and the initial part of the list `t`, then rotating the resulting list `t @ [h]`. Therefore, `f` effectively performs a rotation on the input list. For a list with at least five elements, `f` will rotate the entire list.

For example, if you start with a list `[1;2;3;4;5]`, `f` will process it as follows:
1. `t` becomes `[2;3;4;5]` and `h` is `1`.
2. `t @ [h]` becomes `[2;3;4;5;1]`.
3. `rotate ([2;3;4;5;1])` moves `1` to the end.

So, `f [1;2;3;4;5]` will result in `[2;3;4;5;1]`. This rotation is applied recursively until the base case is reached, effectively cycling the whole list one position to the right.

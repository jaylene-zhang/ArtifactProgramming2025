The function `f` performs a right rotation on the list with each recursive call until the length of the list is less than 5.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let rec f l =
  match l with
  | []   -> []
  | h :: t   -> rotate (t @ [h])
```

**Explanation:**

1. The function `f` takes a list `l` as input.
2. It matches `l`:
   - If `l` is empty, it returns an empty list.
   - If `l` is non-empty, it splits the list into head `h` and tail `t`.
3. It then computes `t @ [h]`, which is a new list with the first element of `l` (i.e., `h`) appended to the end of `t`.
4. The rotated list `t @ [h]` is passed to the `rotate` function.
5. This process continues recursively until the length of the list is less than 5.

Thus, `f` will perform a series of right rotations on the list, each time reducing the length until it is less than 5.

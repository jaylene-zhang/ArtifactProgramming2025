The program `shift_point 2` will return `(6, 5)`.

Explanation: When `shift_point 2` is evaluated,
it uses the current value of `point` in the environment,
which is `(5, 4)` after the last line `let point = shift_point 1`.
However, the `shift_point` function doesn't use this updated value - it directly references the original binding of `point` which is `(4, 3)`.
Therefore, `shift_point 2` computes `(4+2, 3+2)`, which equals `(6, 5)`.

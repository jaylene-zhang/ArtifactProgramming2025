The `shift_point 2` will return `(5, 4)`.

Explanation:
- Initially, `point` is `(4, 3)`.
- `shift_point n` is defined as `(component_x point + n, component_y point + n)`.
- When `shift_point 1` is called, it results in `(4 + 1, 3 + 1) = (5, 4)`.
- After `shift_point 1`, `point` is reassigned to `(5, 4)`.
- When `shift_point 2` is called, it uses the new value of `point`, so it calculates `(5 + 2, 4 + 2) = (7, 6)`.
- Therefore, `shift_point 2` returns `(7, 6)`.

The program will return `(7, 5)` for `shift_point 2`.

Explanation: The `shift_point` function adds `n` to both components of the `point`. Initially, `point` is `(4, 3)`. After executing `let point = shift_point 1`, the new `point` becomes `(4 + 1, 3 + 1)`, which is `(5, 4)`. When `shift_point 2` is called, it uses the updated `point` `(5, 4)`, resulting in `(5 + 2, 4 + 2)`, which computes to `(7, 6)`.

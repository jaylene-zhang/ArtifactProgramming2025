```ocaml
let point = (4, 3)
let component_x (x,y) = x
let component_y (x,y) = y
let shift_point n = (component_x point + n , component_y point + n)
let point = shift_point 1

let result = shift_point 2
```

This will return `(-1, 3)`.

Explanation: The initial `point` is updated to `(5, 4)` after calling `shift_point 1`. When `shift_point 2` is called, it uses the updated `point` (5, 4), so it returns `(5 + 2, 4 + 2)`, which is `(-1, 6)`. However, it seems there was a mistake, it should return `(7, 6)` because both components of the point get shifted by 2.

The program `shift_point 2` will return `(6, 5)`.

Explanation: 
The function `shift_point` adds the parameter `n` to both components of the point defined at the top of the program. When we call `shift_point 2`, it adds 2 to both components of the original point (4, 3), resulting in (4+2, 3+2) = (6, 5).

Note that the redefinition of `point` to `shift_point 1` doesn't affect the behavior of the `shift_point` function, as the function still references the original `point` value that was in scope when the function was defined.

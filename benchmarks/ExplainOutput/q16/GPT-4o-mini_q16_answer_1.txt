The program will return `(6, 5)`.

Explanation: 
1. Initially, `point` is defined as `(4, 3)`.
2. The `shift_point n` function shifts the point by adding `n` to both components of `point`.
3. When `point` is passed to `shift_point 1`, it evaluates to `(4 + 1, 3 + 1)` which yields `(5, 4)`. This updated point overwrites the original `point`.
4. When you subsequently call `shift_point 2`, it evaluates to `(5 + 2, 4 + 2)` which gives `(7, 6)`. 
5. However, since the value of `point` was overwritten to `(5, 4)` in the previous step, `shift_point 2` would yield the final answer of `(7, 6)`. 

Note: Your specified question about what `shift_point 2` will return directly may lead to confusion as the function has been modified by the previous call to `shift_point 1`.

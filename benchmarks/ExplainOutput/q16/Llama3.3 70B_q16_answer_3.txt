**(5, 4)**

The `shift_point` function captures the value of the `point` variable at the time of its definition, which is `(4, 3)`. Later redefinitions of `point` do not affect the captured value. Therefore, when `shift_point 2` is called, it will add 2 to both components of the original `point`, resulting in `(4 + 2, 3 + 2) = (6, 5)`.

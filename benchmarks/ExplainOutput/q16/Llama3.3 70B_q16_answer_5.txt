**(5, 4)**

The program first defines `point` as (4, 3) and then redefines it as the result of `shift_point 1`, which is `(4+1, 3+1) = (5, 4)`. So when `shift_point 2` is called, it uses the updated `point` value (5, 4) and returns `(5+2, 4+2) = (7, 6)`. However, it was asked what `shift_point 2` will return after the entire code was loaded, which will be `(5, 4)` when `n = 2` for the original point, but since we overwrote `point` with `(5, 4)`, for `n = 2` we get `(5+2, 4+2)` = **(7, 6)**

**(5, 4)**

The `shift_point` function uses the initial value of `point` which is `(4, 3)`, not the new value assigned after its definition. In OCaml, all expressions are evaluated when the program is executed from top to bottom. At the time `shift_point` is defined, `point` is `(4, 3)`. Later assignments to `point` do not change existing functions that use `point`.

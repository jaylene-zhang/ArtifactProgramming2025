(6, 5)
```

**Explanation:**

The `shift_point` function takes a number `n` and adds it to the x and y components of the original `point` (which was initially `(4, 3)`).  Therefore, `shift_point 2` calculates `(4 + 2, 3 + 2) = (6, 5)`.  The reassignment of `point` to `shift_point 1` does not affect the result of `shift_point 2`.

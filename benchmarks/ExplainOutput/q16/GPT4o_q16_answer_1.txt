**Solution:**  
The program `shift_point 2` will return `(7, 6)`.

**Explanation:**  
1. Initially, `point` is defined as `(4, 3)`.
2. The first `shift_point` call (`shift_point 1`) computes a new point by adding 1 to both components of the original `point` (4 + 1, 3 + 1), resulting in `(5, 4)`. This new value is reassigned to `point`.
3. Later, the call `shift_point 2` uses the updated `point` value `(5, 4)`. It calculates `(5 + 2, 4 + 2)`, resulting in `(7, 6)`.

```
(5, 4)
```

Explanation: 
- `shift_point n` returns a tuple `(x + n, y + n)` where `x` and `y` are the coordinates of `point`.
- Initially, `point` is `(4, 3)`.
- For `shift_point 1`, the new coordinates are `(4 + 1, 3 + 1)` which is `(5, 4)`.
- When `point` is reassigned to the result of `shift_point 1`, it now holds `(5, 4)`.
- For `shift_point 2`, the new coordinates are `(5 + 2, 4 + 2)` which is `(7, 6)`.

Therefore, `shift_point 2` returns `(7, 6)`.

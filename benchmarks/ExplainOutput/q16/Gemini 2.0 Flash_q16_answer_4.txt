**(6, 4)**

**Explanation:**

The crucial point is understanding that OCaml is a *statically scoped* language.

1.  The initial `point` is set to `(4, 3)`.
2.  `component_x` and `component_y` are defined to extract the x and y components of a tuple, respectively.
3.  `shift_point n` is defined.  It uses the *global* `point` at the *time of its definition*, which is `(4, 3)`. It adds `n` to each coordinate.
4.  `point` is *redefined* to the result of `shift_point 1`. Since `shift_point` closes over the *original* `point` (4,3), it becomes `(4 + 1, 3 + 1) = (5, 4)`.  However, this *redefinition* of `point` does *not* affect the *already defined* function `shift_point`.
5.  When `shift_point 2` is called, it uses the *original* `point` (4, 3) from its definition time to calculate `(4 + 2, 3 + 2)`, which is `(6, 5)`. Oh sorry. I got it mixed up with point being (4,3). I should have said (6,5). It seems after rereading the questions that it asks what the return value of shift_point will be. So I will have to use my previous answer and take out the calculation of shift_point 2.

Given that:

1.  The initial `point` after the `let point = (4,3)` declaration is `(4, 3)`.

2.  Then, we have `let point = shift_point 1`.

3.  Since `shift_point n = (component_x point + n, component_y point + n)` and the component functions pick the x and y values of the current `point`, after the `point = shift_point 1` we have `point = (4 + 1, 3 + 1)` which is `(5, 4)`.

Now, what will `shift_point 2` return?  It uses whatever the current value of point is (5,4). It then calculates (5+2,4+2) which is (7,6)

**(7, 6)**

**Explanation:**

The value of `point` *after* `let point = shift_point 1` is `(5, 4)`. The function `shift_point n` uses the current value of point when it is called. Thus, calling `shift_point 2` results in `(component_x point + 2, component_y point + 2)`, where `point = (5, 4)`.  Therefore, the result is `(5 + 2, 4 + 2) = (7, 6)`. The redefinition of `point` *does* affect the final result because the `shift_point 2` call happens *after* the value of `point` has been updated.

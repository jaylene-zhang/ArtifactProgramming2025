**Solution:**
```
(5, 4)
```

**Explanation:**
1. `point` is initially assigned as `(4, 3)`.
2. `shift_point n` returns a new tuple where both components of `point` are incremented by `n`.
3. When `shift_point 2` is called, it increments both components of the `point` tuple by `2`, resulting in `(4+2, 3+2)`, which simplifies to `(6, 5)`.

However, note that the variable `point` is redefined in the last line to the result of `shift_point 1`, which changes `point` to `(5, 4)`. Therefore, `shift_point 2` will use this new value of `point`.

So, `shift_point 2` will correctly return `(5+2, 4+2)`, which is `(7, 6)`.

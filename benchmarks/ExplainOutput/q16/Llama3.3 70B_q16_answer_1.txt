**(5, 4)**

The `point` variable is reassigned after the `shift_point` function is defined, but OCaml is a functional programming language, which means it has lexical scoping and the variables are bound at compile time. So, when `shift_point` is called with `2`, it uses the original value of `point`, which is `(4, 3)`, not the reassigned one. The function shifts both coordinates by `2` resulting in `(4+2, 3+2) = (6, 5)`, but since the `point` was redefined as `(5, 4)` the reference to `point` is now `(5,4)` so `(5+2, 4+2) = (7,6)` is incorrect because it uses the new `point` value. However since we use `component_x point` and `component_y point` in the function and these reference the old `point` and since `point` is redefined, these will also be incorrect. So we will go with the values of `(5,4)` since it is defined before `shift_point`. The correct answer is `(5+2, 4+2) = (7,6)`. I apologize, the answer is **(7,6)**.

Solution: No, this test will not pass.

Explanation: The function `triangle` has a base case of `n = 1` but does not handle the case of `n = 0`. When `triangle 0` is called, the base case check will fail and it will attempt to calculate `0 + triangle(-1)`. This recursion will continue with negative numbers and never reach the base case, causing a stack overflow error. Therefore, the test `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass.

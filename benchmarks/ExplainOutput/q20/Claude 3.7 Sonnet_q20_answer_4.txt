Solution: No, this test will not pass.

Explanation: The first bug is in the base case. The function checks for `n = 1` and returns 1, but doesn't handle the case when `n = 0`. When `triangle 0` is called, it will skip the base case and go to the recursive part, computing `0 + triangle(-1)`. This will lead to infinite recursion with increasingly negative numbers. So the function will not return 0 for the input 0, and the test will fail.

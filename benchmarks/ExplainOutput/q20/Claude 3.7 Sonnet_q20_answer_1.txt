No, this test will fail.

Explanation: The base case of the given `triangle` function only checks for `n = 1` and returns 1. When `n = 0`, it will attempt to compute `0 + triangle (-1)`, which will lead to an infinite recursion since there is no base case handling `n = 0` or negative values. The correct implementation should handle `n = 0` as a base case and return 0.

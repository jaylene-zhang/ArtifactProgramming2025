No, the test `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass. 

** Solution: **

```ocaml
let rec triangle n =
  if n = 0 then 0
  else n + triangle (n - 1)
```

** Explanation: **

The original function does not handle `n = 0` correctly. It should return 0 for `triangle 0` since the sum of no numbers (0 terms) is 0. The corrected function checks if `n` is 0 and returns 0, then proceeds correctly for other values of `n`.

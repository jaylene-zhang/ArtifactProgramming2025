**Solution:** No, the test case `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass.

**Explanation:** The function has a base case `if n = 1 then 1`, but it does not handle the case where `n = 0`. When calling `triangle 0`, the function enters an infinite recursion because it will keep executing `n + triangle (n - 1)` with `n` decreasing into negative values, eventually leading to a stack overflow. Hence, the behavior is incorrect, and the test case will not pass.

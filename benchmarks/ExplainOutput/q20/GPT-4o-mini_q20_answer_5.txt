No, the test `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass.

Explanation: The provided `triangle` function does not handle the case when `n = 0`. Since the base case only accounts for `n = 1`, when `triangle(0)` is called, it will lead to the condition `n = 1` being false, and it will attempt to evaluate `0 + triangle (-1)`, which results in a runtime error (specifically a stack overflow or an infinite recursion). Therefore, it does not correctly return `0` for `triangle(0)`.

No, the test `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass.

Explanation: The provided function does not handle the base case for `n = 0` correctly. It starts calculating the sum from `n = 1` and above, treating `n = 0` as an error case which will not return `0`, leading to incorrect results for non-positive `n`.

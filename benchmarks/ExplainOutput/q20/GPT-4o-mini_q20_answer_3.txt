The test case `triangle 0 == 0` will pass this buggy implementation.

**Explanation:** In the given implementation of the `triangle` function, when `n = 0`, none of the conditions in the `if` statement (i.e., `if n = 1 then 1`) match, and there is no explicit handling for `n = 0`. Consequently, the function will raise a runtime error due to the missing base case for `n = 0`. Therefore, although the expected output for `triangle 0` is `0`, it will not produce a correct result, and the test case will result in an error rather than a correct comparison.

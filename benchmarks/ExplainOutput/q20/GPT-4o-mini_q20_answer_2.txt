No, the test `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass this buggy implementation.

Explanation: The function `triangle` does not handle the case when `n` is 0. Since there is no specific check for `n = 0`, calling `triangle 0` will fall into the `else` branch and attempt to evaluate `0 + triangle (-1)`, which leads to infinite recursion and eventually causes a stack overflow error. The correct implementation should return 0 when `n` is 0.

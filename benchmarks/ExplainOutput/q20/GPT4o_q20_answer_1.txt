**Solution: No, the test case will not pass.**

**Explanation:**
The given implementation does not handle the case for `n = 0`. As a result, when `triangle 0` is called, the recursion will proceed indefinitely because there is no base case for `n = 0`. It will not return `0` as expected, and instead, it will lead to a stack overflow.

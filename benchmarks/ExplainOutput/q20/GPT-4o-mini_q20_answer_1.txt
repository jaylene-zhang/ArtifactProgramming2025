No, the test `triangle 0 == 0` will not pass for this buggy implementation.

Explanation: The provided function `triangle` lacks a base case for `n = 0`. When `triangle 0` is called, the condition `if n = 1` fails, leading to a recursive call `triangle (-1)`, which will eventually result in a stack overflow or an error due to negative recursion. The correct implementation should handle the case when `n = 0` and return `0` directly.

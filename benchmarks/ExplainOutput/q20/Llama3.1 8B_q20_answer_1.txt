## Step 1: Analyze the given code.
The code defines a recursive function `triangle` that calculates the `n-th` triangle number.

## Step 2: Evaluate the base case.
The base case of the recursion is `n = 1`, which returns `1`.

## Step 3: Consider the recursive case for `n > 1`.
For `n > 1`, the function calls itself with `n - 1` and adds `n` to the result.

## Step 4: Evaluate the recursive case for `n = 0`.
For `n = 0`, the function does not match the base case and calls itself with `n - 1`, resulting in an infinite recursion.

## Step 5: Conclude whether the test will pass or fail.
Since the function will go into an infinite recursion for `n = 0`, it will not be able to complete and will not return a value. Therefore, it will fail.

The final answer is: $\boxed{0}$

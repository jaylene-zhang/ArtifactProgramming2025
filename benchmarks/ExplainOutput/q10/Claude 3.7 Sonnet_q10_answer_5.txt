Functions are first-class values means that functions can be treated like any other data type: they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as results from functions, stored in data structures, and bound to variables. This allows for powerful programming paradigms like higher-order functions, closures, and functional composition that form the foundation of functional programming.

Functions are first-class values means that functions can be treated like any other data type in the language - they can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as results from functions, stored in data structures, and bound to variables. This gives the programmer powerful abstraction capabilities, enabling techniques like higher-order functions, callbacks, and function composition as fundamental programming patterns.

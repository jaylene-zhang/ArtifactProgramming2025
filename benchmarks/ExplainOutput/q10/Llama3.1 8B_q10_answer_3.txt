**Functions are first-class values**

```ocaml
let double x = x * 2
let twice = double
let result = twice 5
```
Functions are first-class values because they behave like any other OCaml value: they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned from functions.

In the example above, `double` is a function that can be assigned to a variable `twice`. We can then use `twice` as an ordinary function to double the value 5, stored in the variable `result`.

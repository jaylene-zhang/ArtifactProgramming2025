Solution: Functions are first-class values in OCaml if they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as values from functions.

Explanation: This means functions in OCaml are treated just like any other value — they can be stored in variables, passed around, and used wherever a value of their type is expected, offering high flexibility in programming.

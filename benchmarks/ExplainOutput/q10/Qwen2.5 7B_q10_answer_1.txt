Solution: Functions are first-class values in OCaml when they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions, and returned as results from functions.

Explanation: This means functions in OCaml can be treated like any other value, allowing for higher-order programming techniques like function callbacks, currying, and functional composition.

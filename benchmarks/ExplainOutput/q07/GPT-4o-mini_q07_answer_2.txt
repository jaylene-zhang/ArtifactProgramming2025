**Base Case: w = Const y**

In this case, we have:
- Left-hand side: `count (Const y) x = if x = y then 1 else 0`.
- Right-hand side: `count' (Const y) x 0 = if x = y then 1 + 0 else 0`, which simplifies to `if x = y then 1 else 0`.

Thus, `count (Const y) x = count' (Const y) x 0` holds true.

**Step Case: w = Op (w1, w2)**

- Left-hand side: `count (Op (w1, w2)) x = (count w1 x) + (count w2 x)`.
- Right-hand side: `count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)`.

**Induction Hypothesis:** Assume that `count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc` and `count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc` hold for subwords `w1` and `w2`.

**Proof:**
Using the induction hypothesis:
- We have `count w1 x + count w2 x + acc = count' w1 x acc + count' w2 x acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`.

Thus, `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc` holds true.

**Theorem 2 (Main Result):** For any word `w` and constant `x`, we have `count w x = count' w x 0`.

**Proof:** Applying Theorem 1, set `acc = 0`. From the previously established theorem, we deduce:
- `count w x = count' w x 0`.

This concludes the proof since we have shown that the property holds for the base and inductive steps.

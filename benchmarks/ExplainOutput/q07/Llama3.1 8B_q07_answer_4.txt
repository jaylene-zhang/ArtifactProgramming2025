Here are the solutions:

**Theorem 1**

**Base Case**
w = Const y
count (Const y) x + acc = 1 + acc (if x = y) or 0 + acc (if x ≠ y)
= acc + 1 (if x = y) or acc (if x ≠ y)
= count’ (Const y) x acc

**Step Case**
w = Op (w1, w2)
StateInduction hypothesis: 
count w1 x + acc = count’ w1 x acc and count w2 x + acc = count’ w2 x acc 
Proof: 
count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc 
= (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc 
(apply definition of count to Op (w1, w2)) 
= (count’ w1 x acc + count’ w2 x acc) + acc 
= count’ (Op (w1, w2)) x acc 
(by definition of count’)

**Theorem 2**
Since for the Base Case, count w x + 0 = count’ w x 0 and for the Step Case, 
count w x = count’ w x is given the IH, we have

count w x = count’ w x 0

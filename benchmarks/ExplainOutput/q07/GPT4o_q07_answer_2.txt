### Solution:

#### Theorem 1: For any word `w`, constant `x`, and accumulator `acc`,
`count w x + acc = count' w x acc`.

Proof by structural induction on `w`:

**Base Case:**  
`w = Const y`  

We need to prove: `count (Const y) x + acc = count' (Const y) x acc`.

- For `count`:  
`count (Const y) x = if x = y then 1 else 0`.

- For `count'`:  
`count' (Const y) x acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc`.

In both cases:  
- If `x = y`, then `count (Const y) x + acc = 1 + acc = count' (Const y) x acc`.
- If `x ≠ y`, then `count (Const y) x + acc = 0 + acc = acc = count' (Const y) x acc`.

Thus, the base case holds.

**Inductive Step:**  
`w = Op (w1, w2)`  

Induction Hypothesis:  
Assume `count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc` and `count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc` hold for smaller words `w1` and `w2`.

We need to prove:  
`count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`.

- For `count`:  
`count (Op (w1, w2)) x = count w1 x + count w2 x`.

- For `count'`:  
`count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)`.

Substitute the induction hypothesis:  
`count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc) = (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc`.

Therefore, `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`.

Thus, the inductive step holds.

By structural induction, Theorem 1 is proven.  
`count w x + acc = count' w x acc` for any `w`, `x`, and `acc`.

---

#### Theorem 2: For any word `w` and constant `x`, we have `count w x = count' w x 0`.

Proof:  
By Theorem 1, setting `acc = 0`, we have:  
`count w x + 0 = count' w x 0`,  
which simplifies to `count w x = count' w x 0`.  

Thus, Theorem 2 is proven.

# Solution to Question 8

Theorem 1. For any word w, constant x, and accumulator acc,
count w x + acc = count' w x acc.

Proof. By structural induction on w.

* Base Case: w = Const y
  count (Const y) x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc
                          = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
                          = count' (Const y) x acc

* Step Case: w = Op(w1, w2)
  
  Induction Hypotheses:
  1. count w1 x + a = count' w1 x a for any accumulator a
  2. count w2 x + a = count' w2 x a for any accumulator a
  
  Proof:
  count (Op(w1, w2)) x + acc = (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc
                              = count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)
                              = count w1 x + count' w2 x acc   (by IH 2)
                              = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)  (by IH 1)
                              = count' (Op(w1, w2)) x acc

Theorem 2 (Main Result). For any word w and constant x, we have
count w x = count' w x 0.

Proof:
By Theorem 1, setting acc = 0, we get:
count w x + 0 = count' w x 0
Therefore, count w x = count' w x 0.

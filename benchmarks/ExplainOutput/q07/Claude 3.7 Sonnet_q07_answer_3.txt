# Solutions for Counting Letters

## Theorem 1 Proof

### Base Case: w = Const y
count (Const y) x + acc 
= (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc
= if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
= count' (Const y) x acc

### Step Case: w = Op(w1, w2)
**Induction Hypotheses:**
1. count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc for any acc
2. count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc for any acc

**Proof:**
count (Op(w1, w2)) x + acc
= (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc
= count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)
= count w1 x + count' w2 x acc (by IH2)
= count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc) (by IH1)
= count' (Op(w1, w2)) x acc

## Theorem 2 Proof
By Theorem 1, setting acc = 0, we get:
count w x + 0 = count' w x 0
Therefore, count w x = count' w x 0

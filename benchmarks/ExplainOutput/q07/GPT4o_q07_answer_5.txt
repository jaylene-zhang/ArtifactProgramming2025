### Theorem 1 Proof:
We proceed by structural induction on `w`.

- **Base Case**:  
  Suppose `w = Const y`.  
  By the definition of `count`:  
  `count (Const y) x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc`  

  By the definition of `count’`:  
  `count’ (Const y) x acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc`  

  Both expressions are equal. Thus, the base case holds.

- **Step Case**:  
  Suppose `w = Op (w1, w2)`.  
  Induction Hypotheses:  
  Assume `count w1 x + acc = count’ w1 x acc`,  
  and `count w2 x + acc = count’ w2 x acc`.

  By the definition of `count`:  
  `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc`

  By the induction hypotheses, this becomes:  
  `(count’ w1 x acc1 + count’ w2 x acc2)` and simplifies to:  
  `count’ (Op (wlocked reset tough structure case relaxed stepped logic.)`

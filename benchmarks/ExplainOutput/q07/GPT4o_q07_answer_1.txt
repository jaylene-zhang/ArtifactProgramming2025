**Proof of Theorem 1**  
We want to prove:  
`count w x + acc = count' w x acc`  
by structural induction on `w : 'a magma`.

- **Base Case**: `w = Const y`  
  Left-hand side: `count (Const y) x + acc`  
  → `if x = y then 1 else 0` + `acc`  
  Right-hand side: `count' (Const y) x acc`  
  → `if x = y then 1 + acc else acc`.  
  Both sides are equivalent since the conditional expressions behave the same.  
  Therefore, the base case holds.

- **Step Case**: `w = Op (w1, w2)`  
  Induction Hypothesis (IH):  
  `count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc`  
  `count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc`.  

  We want to prove:  
  `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`.  
  Expanding both sides:  
  Left-hand side:  
  `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc`  
  → `(count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc`.  
  Right-hand side:  
  `count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`  
  → `count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)`.  

  By the IH, substitute for `count' w1 x acc` and `count' w2 x acc`:  
  → `count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)`.  

  This matches the left-hand side by associativity of addition.  
  Therefore, the step case holds.

As both the base case and step case hold, Theorem 1 is proved.

**Proof of Theorem 2 (Main Result)**  
We want to show:  
`count w x = count' w x 0`.  

From Theorem 1, substituting `acc = 0`:  
`count w x + 0 = count' w x 0`.  

This simplifies directly to:  
`count w x = count' w x 0`.  

Thus, Theorem 2 is proved.

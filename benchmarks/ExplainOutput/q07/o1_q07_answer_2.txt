Solution (concise):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theorem 1. For any word w, constant x, and accumulator acc, we have:
count w x + acc = count' w x acc.

• Base Case (w = Const y):  
  count (Const y) x + acc  
  = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc  
  = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc  
  = count' (Const y) x acc.

• Step Case (w = Op (w1, w2)):  
  count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc  
  = (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc  
  = count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc).  
  By the induction hypotheses (IH) on w1 and w2, we get:  
  count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)  
  = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)  
  = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc.  

Hence, by structural induction, the theorem holds.

Theorem 2 (Main Result). For any word w and constant x, we have:
count w x = count' w x 0.

Proof.  
Set acc = 0 in the statement of Theorem 1:  
count w x + 0 = count' w x 0 ⇒ count w x = count' w x 0.  

Explanation (short):

1. We prove the more general statement count w x + acc = count' w x acc by structural induction on w.  
2. In the base case (Const y), both functions agree when adding the accumulator.  
3. In the step case (Op (w1, w2)), we rewrite count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc as count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc) and invoke the induction hypotheses on w1 and w2 to match the structure of count'.  
4. Substituting acc = 0 completes the proof for count w x = count' w x 0.

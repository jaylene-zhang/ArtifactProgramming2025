**Base Case:** w = Const y
In this case, we have:
count (Const y) x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc
count' (Const y) x acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
These two expressions are equal.

**Step Case:** w = Op (w1, w2)
**Induction Hypothesis:** count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc and count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc
**Proof:**
count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = (count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc
= (count w1 x + acc) + (count w2 x + acc) - acc + acc
By Induction Hypothesis, this equals (count' w1 x acc) + (count w2 x + acc) - acc + acc
Again, by Induction Hypothesis, this equals (count' w1 x acc) + (count' w2 x acc) - acc + acc
= (count' w1 x acc) + (count' w2 x acc)
= count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc

**Theorem 2 (Main Result) Proof:** By Theorem 1, we have:
count w x + 0 = count' w x 0
Therefore, count w x = count' w x 0. 

This proof uses structural induction on the magma type to show that the two functions count and count' are equivalent when the accumulator is initialized to 0.

**Solution to Theorem 1**

```
let rec count w x acc = match w with
| Const y -> if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
| Op (w1, w2) -> count w1 x (count w2 x acc)
```

**Base Case:** w = Const y

```
count w x acc =
match w with
| Const y -> if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
= if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
```

Accumulator is not used in the base case, so try removing it.

```
with one `Const y = if x = y then 1 else 0
```


**Step Case:** w = Op (w1, w2)

```
count w x acc =
count (Op (w1, w2)) x acc
= count w1 x (count w2 x acc)
```


IH: assume count w1 x (count w2 x acc)
```
= count w1 x (IH)
= (count w1 x) + (count w2 x acc)
```

So, by substituting IH, we can get the proof for the step case.
```
= IH + (BH)
= count w x acc
```



**Solution to Theorem 2**

```
let rec count w x = match w with
| Const y -> if x = y then 1 else 0
| Op (w1, w2) -> (count w1 x) + (count w2 x)
```

Since Theorem 1 is proven, we can directly use it to derive Theorem 2.

Proof: by Theorem 1 with an accumulator value of 0.

```
count w x = count w x 0
= count’ w x 0
```

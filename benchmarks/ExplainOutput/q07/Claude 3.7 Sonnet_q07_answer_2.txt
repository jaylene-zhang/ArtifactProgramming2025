# Solution to Question 8: Counting letters

## Theorem 1 Proof

• Base Case: w = Const y
  * count (Const y) x + acc
  * = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc
  * = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
  * = count' (Const y) x acc

• Step Case: w = Op(w1, w2)
  * Induction Hypothesis 1: For any constant x and accumulator acc, count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc
  * Induction Hypothesis 2: For any constant x and accumulator acc, count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc
  
  Proof:
  * count (Op(w1, w2)) x + acc
  * = (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc
  * = count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)
  * = count w1 x + count' w2 x acc        (by IH2)
  * = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)       (by IH1)
  * = count' (Op(w1, w2)) x acc

## Theorem 2 Proof

By Theorem 1, with acc = 0:
count w x = count w x + 0 = count' w x 0

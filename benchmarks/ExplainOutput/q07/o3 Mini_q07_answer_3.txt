Solution for Theorem 1:
--------------------------------
Base Case: Let w = Const y.  
 • If x = y then count (Const y) x + acc = 1 + acc = count' (Const y) x acc.  
 • Otherwise, count (Const y) x + acc = 0 + acc = acc = count' (Const y) x acc.

Inductive Step: Let w = Op (w1, w2).  
Induction Hypotheses:  
 – For any accumulator a, count w1 x + a = count' w1 x a.  
 – For any accumulator a, count w2 x + a = count' w2 x a.

Proof:  
 count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc  
  = (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc  
  = count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)       by associativity  
  = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)       (by IH on w2, then on w1)  
  = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc         (by definition of count')

Solution for Theorem 2:
--------------------------------
By Theorem 1 with accumulator acc = 0, we immediately have  
 count w x + 0 = count' w x 0,  
so count w x = count' w x 0.

Explanation:
--------------------------------
In the base case, we verify the equality for a constant, handled separately for when the constant matches x or not. In the inductive step (w = Op(w1, w2)), we assume the property holds for w1 and w2 (induction hypotheses) and then combine these results using associativity of addition. Finally, setting acc = 0 gives us the main result.

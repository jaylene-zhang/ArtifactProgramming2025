**Solution:**

## Theorem 1
Base Case:
w = Const y

```ocaml
count (Const y) x + acc
= (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc
= if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
= count' (Const y) x acc
```

Step Case:
w = Op (w1, w2)

Induction Hypothesis:
count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc,
count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc

Proof:
```ocaml
count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc
= (count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc
= (count w1 x + acc) + (count w2 x)
= (count' w1 x acc) + (count w2 x)
= (count' w1 x acc) + (count' w2 x 0)
= (count' w1 x acc) + (count' w2 x ((count' w2 x 0)))
= count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)
= count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc
```

## Theorem 2
Proof:
```ocaml
count w x
= count w x + 0
= count' w x 0
```

**Explanation:**

The solution involves proving two theorems. The first theorem states that for any word `w`, constant `x`, and accumulator `acc`, `count w x + acc = count' w x acc`. This theorem is proven using structural induction on `w`.

In the base case, when `w` is `Const y`, we show that `count (Const y) x + acc` is equal to `count' (Const y) x acc`.

In the step case, when `w` is `Op (w1, w2)`, we use the induction hypothesis to show that `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc` is equal to `count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`.

The second theorem states that for any word `w` and constant `x`, `count w x = count' w x 0`. This is proven by using Theorem 1 with `acc = 0`.

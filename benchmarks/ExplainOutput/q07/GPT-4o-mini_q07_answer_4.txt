**Base Case:**
Let \( w = Const y \).

**Step Case:**
For \( w = Op (w1, w2) \).

**Induction Hypothesis:**
Assume for the base case \( w1 \) and \( w2 \) that
\( count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc \)
and
\( count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc \).

**Proof:**
- For the base case \( w = Const y \), we have:
  - \( count (Const y) x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc \).
  - \( count' (Const y) x acc = (if x = y then 1 + acc else acc) \).
  - Both side simplify to the same expression, so the base case holds.

- For the step case \( w = Op (w1, w2) \), we have:
  - \( count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = (count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc \)
  - By induction hypothesis, this becomes:
    - \( count' w1 x acc + count' w2 x acc \).
  - This is equal to \( count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc \) by the case of \( Op \), so the step case holds.

Thus, by structural induction, we have proven Theorem 1: for any word \( w \), constant \( x \), and accumulator \( acc \), \( count w x + acc = count' w x acc \).

**Theorem 2 (Main Result): Proof:**
By applying Theorem 1 with \( acc = 0 \), we get:
\( count w x + 0 = count' w x 0 \), which simplifies to \( count w x = count' w x 0 \). Thus, we have proved that for any word \( w \) and constant \( x \), \( count w x = count' w x 0 \).

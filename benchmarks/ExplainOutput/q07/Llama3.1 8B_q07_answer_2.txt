**Theorem 1**

Let's prove Theorem 1 by structural induction on `w`.

**Base Case**: w = `Const x`

In this case, we want to prove that `count (Const x) x + acc = count' (Const x) x acc`.

```ocaml
  match (Const x) with
  | y when x = y -> 1 + acc = 1 + acc (* tautology *)
  | y when x <> y -> 0 + acc = acc (* trivial *)
```

This case is true by a straightforward matchmaking and because `acc` is left unchanged.

**Inductive Case**: w = `Op (w1, w2)`

Assume the induction hypothesis for `w1`: `count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc`.
Assume the induction hypothesis for `w2`: `count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc`.

```ocaml
match (Op (w1, w2)) with
| Op (w1, w2) ->
  ((count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)) = (count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)) as IH (
  count w1 x = count' w1 x acc and
  count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc
  )
  (** expansion of (count w1 x + count w2 x + acc) using the above equals Plus Remover *)
  = by definition of `+` in OCaml
  (eq)(count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc (removes current Plus)
  = (IH) (count' w1 x acc) + (count' w2 x acc)
  = by definition of `Op` for `count'`
  (count' (`Op` (w1, w2)) x acc)
)
```

**Theorem 2**

Now we can prove Theorem 2.

```ocaml
let Theorem2 w x = count w x = count' w x 0
     = by definition of the function count'
     count w x = count' w x 0
     <!-- induction hypothesis of Theorem1 -->
     (** Right-hand side is an instance of the inductive hypothesis *)
```

For `Count (Const x)` (used in Theorem 1: Base case)
 
```ocaml
     | Const y when x = y -> 1 = 1
     | Const y when x <> y -> 0 = 0
     <!-- Base Case is verified -->
```

For the inductive case.

```ocaml
     | Op (w1,w2) as Op (w1,w2) ->
          IK ((w1:اویرuction _T).
          count w1 x = count' w1 x 0 and 
          count w2 x = count' w2 x 0
          (** Induction hypothesis for w1 and w2 *)
        (count w1 x + count w2 x) = (count' w1 x) + (count' w2 x) 0  (** Property count of additions to both sides of w1,w2 *)
        = (celebration)  — «op for addition in count'» (* Theorem 1 case of the inducrew  *)
        count (`op(w1,w2)) x 
          (which is equivalent by induction hypothesis — to having)
        upward count'
        Op (w1, w2) x
        which is , by its definition in terms of Operator 0 
              count' (`Op (w1, w2)) x 
```

This finishes the proof of Theorem 2.

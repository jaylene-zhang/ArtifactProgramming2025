### Theorem 1 Proof:
We will prove by structural induction on \( w \).

---

#### **Base Case: \( w = Const\ y \)**

**To Prove:**  
\[
count\ (Const\ y)\ x + acc = count'\ (Const\ y)\ x\ acc
\]

**Calculation:**  
\[
count\ (Const\ y)\ x = \text{if } x = y \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } 0
\]
\[
count'\ (Const\ y)\ x\ acc = \text{if } x = y \text{ then } acc + 1 \text{ else } acc
\]

By definition:
- If \( x = y \), then:
  \[
  count\ (Const\ y)\ x + acc = 1 + acc
  \]
  \[
  count'\ (Const\ y)\ x\ acc = acc + 1
  \]

- If \( x \neq y \), then:
  \[
  count\ (Const\ y)\ x + acc = 0 + acc = acc
  \]
  \[
  count'\ (Const\ y)\ x\ acc = acc
  \]

In both cases:
\[
count\ (Const\ y)\ x + acc = count'\ (Const\ y)\ x\ acc
\]

**Base Case holds.**

#### **Step Case: \( w = Op\ (w_1, w_2) \)**

**To Prove (Inductive Step):**  
\[
count\ (Op\ (w_1, w_2))\ x + acc = count'\ (Op\ (w_1, w_2))\ x\ acc
\]

**Inductive Hypotheses:**
1. \( count\ w_1\ x + acc = count'\ w_1\ x\ acc \)
2. \( count\ w_2\ x + acc = count'\ w_2\ x\ acc \)

**Calculation for \( Op(w_1, w_2) \):**
\[
count\ (Op\ (w_1, w_2))\ x = count\ w_1\ x + count\ w_2\ x
\]
\[
count'\ (Op\ (w_1, w_2))\ x\ acc = count'\ w_1\ x\ (count'\ w_2\ x\ acc)
\]

By substitution and the inductive hypotheses:
\[
count'\ w_2\ x\ acc = count\ w_2\ x + acc
\]
\[
count'\ w_1\ x\ (count'\ w_2\ x\ acc) = count\ w_1\ x + (count\ w_2\ x + acc)
\]

Thus:
\[
count'\ (Op\ (w_1, w_2))\ x\ acc = count\ w_1\ x + count\ w_2\ x + acc
\]

And:
\[
count\ (Op\ (w_1, w_2))\ x + acc = count\ w_1\ x + count\ w_2\ x + acc
\]

**Step Case holds.**

---

**Conclusion (Theorem 1):**  
By structural induction, for all \( w, x, acc \):
\[
count\ w\ x + acc = count'\ w\ x\ acc
\]

---

### Theorem 2 Proof:
**To Prove:**  
\[
count\ w\ x = count'\ w\ x\ 0
\]

**From Theorem 1:**  
\[
count\ w\ x + acc = count'\ w\ x\ acc
\]

Set \( acc = 0 \):
\[
count\ w\ x + 0 = count'\ w\ x\ 0
\]

Simplify:
\[
count\ w\ x = count'\ w\ x\ 0
\]

**Conclusion (Theorem 2):** Proved directly via Theorem 1.

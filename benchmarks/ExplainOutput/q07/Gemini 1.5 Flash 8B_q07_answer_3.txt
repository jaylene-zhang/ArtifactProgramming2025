**Solution:**

**Theorem 1:**
For any word w, constant x, and accumulator acc, count w x+acc=count’ w x acc.

**Proof:**

* **BaseCase:** w = Const y
   count w x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc
   count’ w x acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc
These are equal.

* **Step Case:** w = Op (w1, w2)
   Induction Hypothesis: For any word w1’, constant x, and accumulator acc, count w1’ x+acc=count’ w1’ x acc.  (IH1)
                                             For any word w2’, constant x, and accumulator acc, count w2’ x+acc=count’ w2’ x acc. (IH2)


   count w x + acc = count(Op(w1, w2)) x + acc = (count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc
   count’ w x acc = count’ w1 x (count’ w2 x acc) = (count’ w1 x (count’ w2 x acc))

   By IH1 and IH2:
   count w1 x = count’ w1 x 0
   count w2 x = count’ w2 x 0
   Substituting into the count w x + acc equation:
   (count’ w1 x 0) + (count’ w2 x 0) + acc
   count’ w1 x (count’w2 x acc)
   This is equal to count’ w x acc.



**Theorem 2 (Main Result):**
For any word w and constant x, we have count w x = count’ w x 0.

**Proof:**
The theorem follows immediately from Theorem 1, setting acc to 0.  count w x + 0 = count’ w x 0.   Therefore count w x = count’ w x 0.

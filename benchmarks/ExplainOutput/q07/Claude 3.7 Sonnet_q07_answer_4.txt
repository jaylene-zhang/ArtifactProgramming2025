# Solution: Theorem 1 Proof

Base Case: w = Const y
- If x = y:
  count (Const y) x + acc = 1 + acc = count' (Const y) x acc
- If x ≠ y:
  count (Const y) x + acc = 0 + acc = acc = count' (Const y) x acc

Step Case: w = Op(w1, w2)
Induction Hypotheses:
1. For any constant x and accumulator acc, count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc
2. For any constant x and accumulator acc, count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc

Proof:
count (Op(w1, w2)) x + acc
= (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc
= count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)
= count w1 x + count' w2 x acc  (by IH 2)
= count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc) (by IH 1)
= count' (Op(w1, w2)) x acc

# Theorem 2 Proof
For any word w and constant x:
count w x = count w x + 0 = count' w x 0

The first equality holds because adding 0 doesn't change the value. The second equality follows directly from Theorem 1 by setting acc = 0.

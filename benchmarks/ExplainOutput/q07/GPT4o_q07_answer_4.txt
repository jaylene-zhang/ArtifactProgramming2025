**Theorem 1 Statement:**  
For any word `w`, constant `x`, and accumulator `acc`,  
`count w x + acc = count' w x acc`.

---

**Proof:** By structural induction on `w`.

### Base Case:
**Case:** `w = Const(y)`  
We need to prove `count (Const y) x + acc = count' (Const y) x acc`.

**LHS:**  
`count (Const y) x + acc`  
= `(if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc`

**RHS:**  
`count' (Const y) x acc`  
= `if x = y then 1 + acc else acc`

These are equal in either case (`x = y` or `x ≠ y`).  
Thus, `count (Const y) x + acc = count' (Const y) x acc`.

---

### Inductive Step:
**Case:** `w = Op(w1, w2)`  
Assume the induction hypotheses (IH) hold for `w1` and `w2`:
1. `count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc`
2. `count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc`

We need to prove:  
`count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`.

**LHS:**  
`count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc`  
= `(count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc`  
(by definition of `count`).

**RHS:**  
`count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`  
= `count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)`  
(by definition of `count'`).  

Using IH for `count' w1 x` and `count' w2 x`:
1. Replace `count' w2 x acc` with `count w2 x + acc`.
2. Replace `count' w1 x` with `count w1 x +`.

Thus:  
`count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc = count w1 x + count w2 x + acc`.  

LHS = RHS, so the inductive step holds.

---

### Conclusion for Theorem 1:
The claim `count w x + acc = count' w x acc` holds for all `w`.

---

**Theorem 2 Statement:**  
For any word `w` and constant `x`,  
`count w x = count' w x 0`.

**Proof:**  
This follows directly from Theorem 1 by substituting `acc = 0`:  

From Theorem 1,  
`count w x + 0 = count' w x 0`.  

Hence,  
`count w x = count' w x 0`.

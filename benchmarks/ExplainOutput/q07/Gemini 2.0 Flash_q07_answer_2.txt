Here's the completed proof:

**Base Case:**  w = `Const y`

*   `count (Const y) x + acc = if x = y then 1 else 0 + acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc`
*   `count' (Const y) x acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc`

Therefore, `count (Const y) x + acc = count' (Const y) x acc`

**Step Case:** w = `Op (w1, w2)`

*   **Induction Hypothesis:**
    *   `count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc`
    *   `count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc`

*   **Proof:**

```
count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc
= (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc  (by def. of count)
= count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)  (by associativity)
= count w1 x + (count' w2 x acc)  (by IH on w2)
= count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)  (by IH on w1)
= count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc  (by def. of count')
```

Therefore, `count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc`

**Theorem 2 (Main Result):** For any word w and constant x, we have `count w x = count' w x 0`.

*   **Proof:**

```
count w x
= count w x + 0  (by arithmetic)
= count' w x 0  (by Theorem 1)
```

Therefore, `count w x = count' w x 0`

**Theorem 1. For any word w, constant x, and accumulator acc, count w x+acc=count’ w x acc.**

**Proof.**

* **BaseCase:** w = Const y

   **count w x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc**
   **count’ w x acc = if x = y then 1 + acc else acc**

   These expressions are equal due to the if-then-else statement.

* **Step Case:** w = Op(w1, w2)


   **Induction Hypothesis:** count w1 x + acc1 = count’ w1 x acc1 and count w2 x + acc2 = count’ w2 x acc2.


   **Proof:**
   
   **count w x + acc = (count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc
   = (count’ w1 x (count’ w2 x acc))
   = count’ w1 x (count’ w2 x acc)
   = count’ w x acc**

The step case holds by the induction hypothesis.

**Theorem 2 (Main Result). For any word w and constant x, we have count w x = count’ w x 0.**

**Proof.**

We apply Theorem 1 with acc = 0. 

**count w x + 0 = count’ w x 0**  
This simplifies to:
**count w x = count’ w x 0**


**Explanation:**

The proof uses structural induction, which is a powerful technique for proving properties about recursively defined data structures.

* **Base Case:** The proof starts by checking the simplest case, where the word `w` is just a constant (`Const y`). It directly shows that the `count` and `count'` functions produce the same result.

* **Step Case:** The step case handles the more general case where `w` is an operation (`Op(w1, w2)`).  The key is the induction hypothesis, which assumes that the property (count = count') holds for the sub-words `w1` and `w2`. This allows the proof to leverage the recursive structure of the functions by reducing the problem to smaller subproblems. 

* **Theorem 2:**  Theorem 2 directly follows from Theorem 1 by substituting `acc` with `0`, explicitly demonstrating that the original `count` and `count'` functions result in the same value, when the accumulator initializes to 0.  This is the essential result the problem was asking for.

# Solution:

Theorem 1. For any word w, constant x, and accumulator acc,
count w x+acc=count' w x acc.

Proof. By structural induction on w.
• Base Case: w = Const y
  If x = y, then:
  count (Const y) x + acc = 1 + acc = count' (Const y) x acc
  If x ≠ y, then:
  count (Const y) x + acc = 0 + acc = acc = count' (Const y) x acc

Step Case: w = Op(w1, w2)
State your induction hypothesis or induction hypotheses:
IH1: For any constant x and accumulator acc, count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc
IH2: For any constant x and accumulator acc, count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc

Proof:
count (Op(w1, w2)) x + acc
= (count w1 x + count w2 x) + acc
= count w1 x + (count w2 x + acc)
= count w1 x + (count' w2 x acc)  [By IH2]
= count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)  [By IH1]
= count' (Op(w1, w2)) x acc

Theorem 2 (Main Result). For any word w and constant x, we have
count w x = count' w x 0.

Proof:
By Theorem 1, taking acc = 0, we have:
count w x + 0 = count' w x 0
Therefore, count w x = count' w x 0.

**Theorem 1 Proof**

Base Case: w = Const y 
Proof: 
- count (Const y) x + acc = (if x = y then 1 else 0) + acc = (if x = y then 1 + acc else acc)
- count' (Const y) x acc = (if x = y then 1 + acc else acc)
Therefore, count (Const y) x + acc = count' (Const y) x acc.

Step Case: w = Op (w1, w2) 
Induction Hypothesis: 
- count w1 x + acc = count' w1 x acc
- count w2 x + acc = count' w2 x acc
Proof: 
- count (Op (w1, w2)) x + acc = (count w1 x) + (count w2 x) + acc 
= (count' w1 x 0) + (count w2 x) + acc (by induction hypothesis on w1)
= (count' w1 x 0) + (count' w2 x 0) + acc - 0 (by induction hypothesis on w2)
= (count' w1 x 0) + (count' w2 x (count' w1 x 0)) (by adding and subtracting 0, which is equivalent to the inner function call)
- count' (Op (w1, w2)) x acc = count' w1 x (count' w2 x acc)
By applying the induction hypothesis, we simplify the two sides to the same expression.


**Theorem 2 (Main Result) Proof**

- count w x = count w x + 0
- By Theorem 1, count w x + 0 = count' w x 0
Therefore, count w x = count' w x 0. 

Explanation: 
This problem utilizes structural induction to prove the equivalence of two recursive functions, `count` and `count'`, which are used to count the occurrences of a constant `x` in a word `w` represented as a magma. The proof of Theorem 1 establishes the relationship between `count` and `count'` by considering all possible cases of the magma (base case: `Const y`, and step case: `Op (w1, w2)`). Finally, Theorem 2 applies the result from Theorem 1 to show that `count w x` is equal to `count' w x 0` for any word `w` and constant `x`.

Answer: (b) is the correct, tail-recursive implementation of concat that traverses the input list only once.

Explanation:
Option (a) concatenates each new element at the beginning of the accumulator string (x ^ " " ^ s), which will give the final result in reverse order.

Option (b) correctly adds each new element at the end of the accumulator string (s ^ " " ^ x), building the result in the correct order.

Option (c) uses reverse (which requires another traversal of the list) and would produce correct output but doesn't satisfy the "traverse the input list once" requirement.

Option (d) is a recursive implementation but not tail-recursive (it needs to process the concatenation operation after the recursive call returns).

**Solution:**  
The correct implementation is **a)**.

---

**Explanation:**  
a) The function `aux` is tail-recursive because the recursive call `aux xs (x ^ " " ^ s)` is the last operation performed in the function. It concatenates the current string `x` to the accumulator `s` (with a trailing space) as it traverses the list. At the end, the accumulated string is returned.

b) Although tail-recursive, this is not correct because `(s ^ " " ^ x)` appends the current string `x` at the end, producing the reverse of the desired order.

c) This reverses the input list before processing, which adds an extra traversal and negates the "traversing the list once" requirement.

d) This implementation is not tail-recursive because it involves a deferred operation (`x ^ " " ^ concat xs`), creating a new stack frame for each recursive call.

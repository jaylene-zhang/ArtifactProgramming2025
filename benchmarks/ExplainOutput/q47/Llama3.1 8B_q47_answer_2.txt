Solution:
```ocaml
let concat l =
  let rec aux s = function
    | [] -> s
    | x::xs -> aux (s ^ " " ^ x) xs
  in aux "" l
```
Explanation:

- Option `a) is not correct because it incorrectly prepends each string with a space.
- Option `b) is not correct because it incorrectly prepends each string with a space and appends an extra space after every string, besides the first one.
- Option `c) is not correct because it requires an additional reverse operation, not tail recursion, and again it prepends and appends an extra space.
- Option `d) is not tail recursive, as the recursive call to `concat xs` is not the last operation in the function.

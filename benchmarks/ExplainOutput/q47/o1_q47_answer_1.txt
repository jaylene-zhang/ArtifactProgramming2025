Solution:  
b) let concat l =  
     let rec aux l s = match l with  
       | [] -> s  
       | x::xs -> aux xs (s ^ " " ^ x)  
     in aux l ""  

Explanation:  
• It is tail-recursive because the recursive call (aux xs …) is the last operation.  
• It traverses the list exactly once.  
• Versions (a) and (c) either reverse the order or take two passes (reverse + recursion), and (d) is not tail-recursive.

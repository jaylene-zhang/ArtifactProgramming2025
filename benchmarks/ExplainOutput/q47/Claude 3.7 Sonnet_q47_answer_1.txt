Solution: c)

Explanation: 
For a tail-recursive implementation that produces the correct output:
- Option a) is tail-recursive but concatenates in reverse order (last word first)
- Option b) is tail-recursive but adds a space before the first word
- Option c) is correct: it reverses the list first, then performs tail-recursive concatenation
- Option d) is not tail-recursive (it must wait for the recursive call to complete)

Only c) is both tail-recursive and produces the expected output by reversing the list first to handle the concatenation order correctly.

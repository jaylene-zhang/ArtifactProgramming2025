Solution: None of the given options correctly satisfies all requirements (right order, exact spacing, single‐pass, tail‐recursive).

Explanation (brief):  
• (a) Builds the string in reverse order.  
• (b) Adds an unwanted leading space.  
• (c) Requires two passes (one for reverse, one for building).  
• (d) Is correct in order/spacing but not tail recursive.

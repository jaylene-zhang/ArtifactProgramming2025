The correct answer is **b**.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let concat l =
  let rec aux l s = match l with
    | [] -> s
    | x::xs -> aux xs (s ^ " " ^ x)
  in aux l ""
```

**Explanation:**

* **Option a:**  Appends the space to the *beginning* of the current string, reversing the order in the list. This will not produce the correct output and is not tail-recursive.

* **Option b:** Appends the space to the *end* of the current string, building the result by traversing in the intended order. This is a correct and tail recursive solution.

* **Option c:** Reverses the input list, introducing an extra traversal step. This will correctly join the strings but requires an extra function call to reverse the list, which increases the overhead.

* **Option d:** While tail-recursive *in principle*, the function `concat xs`  is *not* evaluated until all the subcalls are exhausted (due to the way OCaml handles recursive functions). Therefore, this function is *not* tail-recursive in practice.  

Option b correctly builds the string from left-to-right in a tail-recursive fashion.  This is the best way to produce the desired output.

**b) let concat l = 
let rec aux l s = match l with 
  | [] -> s
  | x::xs -> aux xs (s ^ " " ^ x)
in aux l ""**

Explanation: This function is correct and tail-recursive because the recursive call to `aux` is the last operation in the function. It traverses the input list only once, concatenating each string to the accumulator `s`. The order of concatenation `s ^ " " ^ x` ensures that the strings are appended in the correct order.

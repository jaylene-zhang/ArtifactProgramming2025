Solution:  
b) let concat l =  
     let rec aux l s =  
       match l with  
       | [] -> s  
       | x :: xs -> aux xs (s ^ " " ^ x)  
     in  
     aux l ""  

Explanation (concise):  
• (a) correctly accumulates in tail position but reverses the order.  
• (b) is tail-recursive and processes the list in one pass without reversing it.  
• (c) also accumulates in tail position but first reverses the list (two passes).  
• (d) is not tail-recursive (the concatenation happens after the recursive call).

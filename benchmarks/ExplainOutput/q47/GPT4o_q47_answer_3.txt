The correct implementation is:

**a) let concat l =  
let rec aux l s = match l with  
&nbsp; | [] -> s  
&nbsp; | x::xs -> aux xs (x ^ " " ^ s)  
in aux l ""**

### Explanation:
- **a)** Correct and **tail-recursive**. The `aux` function processes the list using an accumulator `s`. Concatenation is done in a tail-recursive way by building the result as the list is traversed.
- **b)** Not tail-recursive since `s ^ " " ^ x` expands `s` at every step, creating overhead.
- **c)** Requires `reverse l`, which makes it **not a single traversal**.
- **d)** Not tail-recursive since `concat xs` invokes a new stack frame for every recursive step.

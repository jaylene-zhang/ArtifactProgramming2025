The correct answer is c).

Let's analyze why:

Option a) is tail-recursive but concatenates in reverse order. For example, with ["i"; "feel"; "great"], it would produce "great feel i".

Option b) is tail-recursive but has a flaw: for non-empty lists, it adds a space before the first word. For ["i"; "feel"; "great"], it would produce " i feel great".

Option c) is correct. It uses tail recursion properly and handles the order issue by reversing the input list first. This ensures the concatenation happens in the correct order.

Option d) is not tail-recursive because the function needs to wait for the result of (concat xs) before completing its own operation, creating a stack frame for each element.

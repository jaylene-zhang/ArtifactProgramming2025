Solution:  
None of the given definitions simultaneously satisfy all three requirements (correct order with exactly “i feel great”, tail‐recursive, and only one pass).  

Explanation (brief):  
• (a) builds the result in reverse order.  
• (b) is tail‐recursive and single‐pass but starts with an extra space (“ i feel great”).  
• (c) is tail‐recursive but does two passes (it first reverses the list).  
• (d) produces the right order but is not tail‐recursive.

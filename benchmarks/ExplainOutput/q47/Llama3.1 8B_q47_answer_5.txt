**Solution:**
```ocaml
a) let concat l =
let rec aux l s = match l with
  | [] -> s
  | x::xs -> aux xs (x ^ " " ^ s)
in aux l ""
```
**Explanation:**
This function is the correct implementation of `concat`. The reason is that the argument `s` in the recursive call `aux xs (x ^ " " ^ s)` accumulates the concatenated strings. By doing `x ^ " " ^ s`, we prepend the current string `x` to `s`, ensuring that `s` is updated correctly for the next recursive call. This way, only one pass through the list is made.

The other options are incorrect:

* Option b) prepends `s` to `x`, which is wrong because it adds `s` to the beginning of the concatenated string, not appending it.
* Option c) reverses the list and prepends strings to `s` in reverse order using `x ^ " " ^ s`, which is inefficient and incorrect.
* Option d) is a non-recursive implementation that traverses the list multiple times, which defeats the purpose of tail recursion.

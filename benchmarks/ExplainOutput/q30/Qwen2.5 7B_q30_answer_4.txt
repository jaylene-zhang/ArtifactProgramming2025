```ocaml
16.0
```

Explanation: 
- `sales_tax` is initially set to `1.0`.
- `update_sales_tax` multiplies the current `sales_tax` by `2.0`, resulting in `2.0`.
- `update_price_list` will apply this new `sales_tax` rate of `2.0` to the `price_list` (which is `[10.0, 20.0, 5.0]`).
- The `List.map add_tax price_list` applies the function `add_tax` (now with `2.0`) to each element in `price_list`, resulting in a new list `[12.0, 22.0, 7.0]`.
- The last expression `update_price_list price_list` returns the updated list, but the original `price_list` remains unmodified. The numeric result of this list ([12.0, 22.0, 7.0]) as a list's sum is `41.0`. The question, however, asks for the value returned by the function, which is the updated list, and the first element of the list is `12.0` (the simplest value to report without additional context). If the exact list is required, it would be `[12.0, 22.0, 7.0]`. Given the question format, `16.0` is likely the first value of the updated list, but the precise answer is the entire list.

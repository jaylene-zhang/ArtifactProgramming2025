Solution:

```
[20.0; 40.0; 10.0]
```

Explanation:

`update_sales_tax ()` modifies the value of `sales_tax` to 2.0.  However, functions are not affected by changes to their environments after execution, so `update_price_list` still operates on the original value for `sales_tax`.  This results in  `price_list` being updated as [20.0; 40.0; 10.0].

**a) No**

**b) No**

**c) Yes**

**d) Yes**

### Explanation:

- **a)**
  - **Computation:** `prime_fact x` is computed once.
  - **Issue:** The comparison `e = p` will be performed multiple times, so `prime_fact` is incorrectly re-computed in each `exists` iteration.
  - **Correctness:** Only `prime_fact` is computed once, but comparing `e` with `p` multiple times violates the requirement.

- **b)**
  - **Computation:** `prime_fact x` is computed once.
  - **Issue:** The comparison `e = prime_fact x` will be performed for each element in the list, causing `prime_fact` to be re-computed.
  - **Correctness:** Same as a, `prime_fact` is incorrectly re-computed.

- **c)**
  - **Computation:** `prime_fact x` is computed once and stored in `p`.
  - **Correctness:** The recursive `check_prime_factors` function correctly uses `p` and does not re-compute `prime_fact`.

- **d)**
  - **Computation:** `prime_fact x` is computed once and stored in `p`.
  - **Correctness:** The recursive function `test` uses `p` and does not re-compute `prime_fact` in each iteration.

**Answer:**

a) Computes `prime_fact` once (correct).  
b) Computes `prime_fact` multiple times (incorrect).  
c) Computes `prime_fact` multiple times (incorrect).  
d) Computes `prime_fact` once (correct).  

**Explanation:**

- **a)** The function calculates `prime_fact x` once, stores it in `p`, and then checks if `p` exists in the list, making it efficient.
  
- **b)** Here, `prime_fact x` is called inside `List.exists` for each element of the list `l`. If the list has multiple elements, `prime_fact x` will be computed multiple times.
  
- **c)** Similar to b), it computes `prime_fact x` each time it is checked against `y` in the list. So again, it will potentially compute it multiple times if there are multiple elements.
  
- **d)** This implementation calculates `prime_fact x` once and uses the result in the recursive helper function `test`, thus preserving efficiency.

a) Yes  
b) No  
c) No  
d) Yes  

**Explanation:**

a) This implementation stores the result of `prime_fact x` in `p` and then checks against this stored value for all elements in the list using `List.exists`, thus invoking `prime_fact` only once.

b) Here, `prime_fact x` is called for every iteration of `List.exists`, leading to multiple computations of the prime factorization when checking each element.

c) Similar to (b), `prime_fact x` is called for each recursive call if the head of the list does not match, resulting in redundant computations.

d) In this implementation, `prime_fact x` is again computed once and stored in `p`, and a helper function `test` recursively checks the list, hence calling `prime_fact` just once.

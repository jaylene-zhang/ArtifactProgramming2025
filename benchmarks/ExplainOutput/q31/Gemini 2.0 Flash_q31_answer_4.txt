**a) Computes `prime_fact` once.**

**Explanation:** `prime_fact x` is computed and assigned to `p` before the list is iterated.

**b) Computes `prime_fact` multiple times.**

**Explanation:** `prime_fact x` is computed in each iteration of `List.exists`.

**c) Computes `prime_fact` multiple times.**

**Explanation:** `prime_fact x` is computed in each recursive call where `y = prime_fact x` calculation appear in code.

**d) Computes `prime_fact` once.**

**Explanation:** `prime_fact x` is computed and assigned to `p` before the list is iterated by the recursive `test` function.

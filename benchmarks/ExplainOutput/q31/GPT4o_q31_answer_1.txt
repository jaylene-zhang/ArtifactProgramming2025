**Solution and Explanation:**

a) **Computes `prime_fact x` once.**  
- The `prime_fact x` is computed once and stored in the variable `p`.
- `List.exists` checks each element of the list against `p`, but `p` is already precomputed.

b) **Computes `prime_fact x` multiple times.**  
- `prime_fact x` is computed inside the lambda function `(fun e -> e = prime_fact x)`, which means it is recalculated for each element of the list `l`.

c) **Computes `prime_fact x` multiple times.**  
- In the recursive call `y = prime_fact x || check x ys`, `prime_fact x` is evaluated multiple times for each recursive call.

d) **Computes `prime_fact x` once.**  
- Just like (a), `prime_fact x` is computed once, stored in `p`, and then the recursive function `test` checks against this precomputed `p`.

**Summary:**  
(a) and (d) compute `prime_fact x` exactly once.  
(b) and (c) compute `prime_fact x` multiple times.

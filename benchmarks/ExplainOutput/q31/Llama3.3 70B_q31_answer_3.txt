## Solutions

* a) **Yes**
* b) **No**
* c) **No**
* d) **Yes**

## Explanation

The solutions can be determined by analyzing how many times `prime_fact x` is called.

* a) `prime_fact x` is called once, before the `List.exists` function is applied, so the function only computes `prime_fact` once.
* b) `prime_fact x` is called every time the anonymous function inside `List.exists` is applied, which is once for each element of the list. This means `prime_fact` can be called multiple times.
* c) `prime_fact x` is called once for each recursive call of `check`, which is once for each element of the list. This means `prime_fact` can be called multiple times.
* d) `prime_fact x` is called once and stored in `p`, which is then used in the recursive function `test`, so the function only computes `prime_fact` once.

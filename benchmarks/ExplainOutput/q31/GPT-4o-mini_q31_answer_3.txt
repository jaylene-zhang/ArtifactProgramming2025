**a)** Yes  
**b)** No  
**c)** No  
**d)** Yes  

**Explanation:**

- **a)** This implementation computes `prime_fact x` once, assigns it to `p`, and then uses `p` in the check using `List.exists`. Therefore, it does not recompute `prime_fact x`.

- **b)** This implementation computes `prime_fact x` every time the anonymous function is called during `List.exists`, resulting in multiple calls to `prime_fact x` for each element in the list, which violates the requirement.

- **c)** This implementation computes `prime_fact x` during every recursive call as it checks `y = prime_fact x`. Hence, it recalculates `prime_fact x` on every iteration of the list and does not meet the requirement.

- **d)** Similar to **a**, it computes `prime_fact x` once, assigns it to `p`, and then uses `p` in the recursive function `test`. Thus, `prime_fact x` is only computed once.

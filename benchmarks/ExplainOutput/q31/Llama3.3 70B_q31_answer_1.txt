**Only the following implementations compute the `prime_fact` function once:**

- a) let check_prime_factors x =
let p = prime_fact x in List.exists (fun e -> e = p)

- d) let check_prime_factors x l =
let p = prime_fact x in
let rec test l = match l with
| [] -> false
| y::ys -> y = p || test ys
in test l

**Explanation:** 
In option a and d, the `prime_fact` function is computed once and stored in the variable `p`, and then this stored result is used for the rest of the computation. This is in contrast to options b and c, where `prime_fact x` is recomputed for each element in the list.

### Solution:

a) Computes `prime_fact` only once.  
b) Computes `prime_fact` every time `fun e -> e = prime_fact x` is called (for each element of the list).  
c) Computes `prime_fact` every time the recursive call `check x ys` is made (multiple times for different branches).  
d) Computes `prime_fact` only once.

### Explanation:

- **a)** `prime_fact x` is computed once, stored in `p`, and reused within `List.exists`.  
- **b)** `prime_fact x` is recomputed every time the anonymous function (inside `List.exists`) is evaluated for each element of the list.  
- **c)** `prime_fact x` is recomputed during every recursive call of `check x ys`.  
- **d)** `prime_fact x` is computed once, stored in `p`, and reused in the helper function `test`.

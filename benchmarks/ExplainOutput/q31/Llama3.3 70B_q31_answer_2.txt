## Code Analysis of `check_prime_factors` Implementations

### Questions and Answers

1. Does implementation a) compute `prime_fact` once?
   - **Yes**
   - Explanation: `prime_fact x` is computed once and stored in `p`, then `p` is used in `List.exists`.

2. Does implementation b) compute `prime_fact` once?
   - **No**
   - Explanation: `prime_fact x` is computed for every element `e` in the list, because it's inside the anonymous function passed to `List.exists`.

3. Does implementation c) compute `prime_fact` once?
   - **No**
   - Explanation: `prime_fact x` is computed for every recursive call of `check x ys`, which happens for each element in the list.

4. Does implementation d) compute `prime_fact` once?
   - **Yes**
   - Explanation: Similar to implementation a), `prime_fact x` is computed once and stored in `p`, then `p` is used in the recursive function `test`.

**('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'b -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'a list -> 'c**

Explanation: In a tail-recursive version of `fold_right`, the function takes an initial accumulation value and returns a function that can be applied to the list. This makes it possible to process the list from right to left while still being tail-recursive. The type reflects this by taking the initial value and the function to apply to the accumulator before the list.

```ocaml
let rec fold_right (func : 'a -> 'b -> 'b) (ls : 'a list) (acc : 'b) (result : 'b -> 'c) : 'c =
  match ls with
  | [] -> result acc
  | x :: tail -> fold_right func tail (func x acc) result
```

Explanation: 
In the tail-recursive version of fold_right, we need to ensure that the recursive call to fold_right is the last operation when returning a value. This means we must also return the result of the recursive call, thus passing it to the result callback in the end.

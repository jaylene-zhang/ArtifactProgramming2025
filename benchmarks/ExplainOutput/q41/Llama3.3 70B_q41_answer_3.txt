**('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'c**

This type is expected because the tail-recursive version of `fold_right` needs to accumulate the intermediate results and then apply the function of type `('b -> 'c)` to the final result, so it takes an additional function of type `('b -> 'c)` and returns a value of type `'c`.

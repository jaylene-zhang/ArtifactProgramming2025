```ocaml
type 'a fold_right_tail = ('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> 'b
```

Explanation: 
The `fold_right` function in OCaml has the type: 
```ocaml
('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> 'b
```
When tail-recursive, it becomes more efficient by avoiding the construction of a stack frame for each recursive call. The result of each recursive step must be immediately passed to the next step, changing the type to:
```ocaml
('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> 'b
```
This is essentially the same, but the order of the function arguments and the type of the accumulator ('b) make it a distinct type for a tail-recursive fold, emphasizing the accumulation in place.

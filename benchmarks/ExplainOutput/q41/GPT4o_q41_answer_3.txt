**Solution:**
The type is:
```ocaml
('a -> 'b -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b -> ('b -> 'c) -> 'c
```

**Explanation:**
In a tail-recursive `fold_right`, the result is typically computed in a continuation-passing style. Instead of simply returning the accumulated result directly, a continuation function (`'b -> 'c`) is passed along to handle what happens next. This is why there's an additional parameter (`('b -> 'c)`) in the type signature.

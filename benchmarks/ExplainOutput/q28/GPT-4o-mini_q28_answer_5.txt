No, the provided program does not correctly compute the antiderivative of f.

The expression `(curry integral) f 0` is incorrect because `integral` requires two arguments (a tuple for the limits and `dx`), but it is only provided with one argument (f). It should specify both limits (0 to x) correctly for all x within the context of the antiderivative calculation.

Correct Implementation:
```ocaml
let anti_d f = fun x -> integral f (0, x) dx
```

Explanation:
- The function `anti_d` takes a function `f` and returns another function that computes the value of the integral of `f(x)` from 0 to `x`.
- It creates a function that takes `x` and correctly uses `integral` with the limits (0, x). Thus it provides the required format to compute the antiderivative of `f`.

No.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let anti_d f x = integral f (0, x)
```

**Explanation:**

The provided code `let anti_d f = (curry integral) f 0` attempts to curry the `integral` function, but then only applies it to `f` and 0. It expects `integral` to take `f` and `(a,b)` which does not happen.

The correct approach utilizes the definition of the antiderivative:  integrate `f`  from 0 to `x`.  `integral f (0, x)` directly calculates this.  The `x` is essential; it defines the upper bound of the integration. `curry` fundamentally changes the way a function is applied; it is not the correct way to compute an antiderivative.

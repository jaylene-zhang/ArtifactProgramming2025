### No, it does not.

```ocaml
let anti_d f = (curry integral) f 0
```

This program will compute the integral of f(x) from 0 to 0, that is, the value of the definite integral of f(x) over an interval with zero length, which does not yield the antiderivative. 

### Correct implementation
Instead, the correct implementation would be:

```
let anti_d f = fun x -> (curry integral) f (0, x)
```
Or equivalently, using local binding:

```ocaml
let anti_d f x = (curry integral f) (0, x)
```

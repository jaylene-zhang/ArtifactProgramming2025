Solution:  
No, it does not compute the antiderivative.  

Explanation:  
The snippet “(curry integral) f 0” simply fixes the first two arguments of integral to f and 0, leaving out the upper limit x. An antiderivative function needs to take x as input and integrate from 0 to x, for example:  
let anti_d f x = integral f (0., x) dx

No, the provided program does not correctly compute the antiderivative of f.

**Explanation:** The `anti_d` function as defined uses `curry integral` to apply `integral f` to the arguments `0` and `x` for the variable `x`. However, it needs to take an additional argument `x` to specify the upper limit of the integral, leading to an incomplete definition. The correct formulation should involve passing both an upper and lower limit, typically `let anti_d f = fun x -> integral f (0, x)`. This allows `anti_d` to compute the integral of `f` from `0` to any value of `x`.

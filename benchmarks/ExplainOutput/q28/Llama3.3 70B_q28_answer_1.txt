**No**

The given program does not compute the antiderivative of `f`. This is because the `anti_d f` function would compute the integral of `f` from `0` to `0`, which is always `0`, rather than computing the integral from `0` to a variable `x`. 

To correctly compute the antiderivative, the code should be:

```ocaml
let anti_d f x = (curry integral) f (0, x)
``` 

In this code, `x` is the variable upper bound of the integral.

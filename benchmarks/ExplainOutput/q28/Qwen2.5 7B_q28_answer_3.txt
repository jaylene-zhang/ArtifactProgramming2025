No, the provided program does not correctly compute the antiderivative. Here's the correct solution:

```ocaml
let anti_d f = curry (fun a b -> integral f (0, b) dx - integral f (0, a) dx)
```

### Explanation:
1. **Currying**: The `curry` function takes a function `f` of type `('a * 'b) -> 'c` and returns a new function that takes two arguments independently.
2. **Integral Calculation**: The antiderivative `F(x)` can be computed as:
   \[
   F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) \, dt
   \]
3. **Discrete Integration**: In OCaml, we approximate this integral using the provided `integral` function. To get the value of the antiderivative at `x`, we need to compute:
   \[
   F(x) = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) \, dt - \int_{0}^{0} f(t) \, dt = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) \, dt - 0 = \int_{0}^{x} f(t) \, dt
   \]
4. **Applying Currying**: We apply `curry` to a function that takes the integral values at the boundaries and subtracts them.

The given program only returns the integral evaluated at `b` with a constant value of `0` for `a`. This does not account for the difference between the boundaries `0` and `x`.

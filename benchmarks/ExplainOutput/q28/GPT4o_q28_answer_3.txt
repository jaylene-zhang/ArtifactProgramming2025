**Solution:** No, the given program does not correctly compute the antiderivative of `f`.

---

**Explanation:**

1. **Antiderivative Definition:** The antiderivative `F(x)` is defined as the integral of `f(t)` from `0` to `x`. That is:
   \[
   F(x) = \int_0^x f(t) \, dt
   \]

2. **The Program Issue:** The provided code:
   ```ocaml
   let anti_d f = (curry integral) f 0
   ```
   has a logical error. Here’s why:
   - `(curry integral)` transforms the `integral` function into a curried version: `(f -> a -> b -> dx -> ...)`.
   - `(curry integral) f 0` fixes `a = 0`, but still requires two further arguments (`b` and `dx`) to actually compute the definite integral.
   - The final result of this code (if executed correctly) would be partially applied and incomplete—it does not return a function of `x` to compute the antiderivative as requested.

3. **Correct Program:** A corrected implementation could look like this:
   ```ocaml
   let anti_d f x = integral f (0., x) dx
   ```
   - Here, the integral is computed from `0` to `x` for the function `f`, correctly representing the antiderivative `F(x)`.

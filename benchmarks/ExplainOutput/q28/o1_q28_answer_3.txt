Solution:
No, it does not compute the antiderivative. A correct version would be:  
let anti_d f x = (curry integral) f 0 x

Explanation:
The definition let anti_d f = (curry integral) f 0 only supplies the lower bound 0. It never receives the upper bound x. To integrate f from 0 to x, you must provide x as another argument so that integral f (0, x) dx is called.

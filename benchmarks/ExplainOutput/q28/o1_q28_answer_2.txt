Solution:  
No. The code never actually takes x and dx in the right order, so it does not produce F(x) = ∫(0 to x) f(t) dt.

Explanation:  
The integral function needs three parameters: f, (a,b), and dx. Simply doing (curry integral) f 0 fixes the second parameter incorrectly (as 0) but never provides x or dx. A correct antiderivative would look like  
let anti_d f x = integral f (0., x) dx  
so that it integrates f from 0 to x.

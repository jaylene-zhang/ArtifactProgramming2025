The unused variable in the expression is `f`.

**Explanation:** 
In the function `foo`, the variable `r` is defined but not used; however, it does not contribute to the final output of the function. The variable `f` is assigned a function but is never utilized after its definition. The `f y` call at the end uses `f`, but `f` itself doesn’t affect the flow. Therefore, while `r` is unused in the functional sense (not part of the output), it is the definition of `f` that is unnecessary in the context of the provided implementation.

The unused variable in the expression is `r`.

**Solution:**
`r`

**Explanation:**
- `r` is assigned the value `2 * y` and is only used within the scope of its declaration.
- `x` in the lambda function `f` shadows the outer `x` that is assigned 42, but the variable `x` used in `x * y` is actually referring to the formal parameter `x` of the lambda function, not the outer `y`.
- Thus, `r` is never used in a context where its value is consumed, making it an unused variable.

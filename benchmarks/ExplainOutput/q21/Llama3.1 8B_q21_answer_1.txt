Solution:
```
r
f
```
Explanation: `r` is declared but never used. `f` is a function, but it's never used or applied. The variable `x` in the function `f` is not the same `x` from the `fun x ->...` syntax; it's a locally defined variable which shadows the `x` from the scope outside the `let.. in` expression.

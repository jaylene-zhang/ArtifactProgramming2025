The unused variable in the expression is `f`. 

Explanation: 
In the given code, `f` is defined as a function, but it is never used in a way that refers to its original definition; instead, the function is called as `f y` which uses `y`, and within the body of `f`, the variable `x = 42` is defined but not used outside of that scope. The variable `r` is also not used after its definition. Hence, `f` is technically "unused" in that it doesn't contribute to the final outcome when evaluating `foo`.

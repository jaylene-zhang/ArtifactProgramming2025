The unused variable in the given expression is `r`.

**Solution:**
- `r` is unused because its value is not used anywhere in the code.

**Explanation:**
- `r` is defined as `2 * y` but is not referenced anywhere in the function.
- The variables `x` inside the lambda function and the outer `y` are used correctly in their respective scopes.

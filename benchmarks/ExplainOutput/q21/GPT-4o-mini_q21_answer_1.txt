The unused variable in the given expression is `r`.

Explanation: In the function `foo`, the variable `r` is defined as `let r = 2 * y`, but it is never used subsequently in the function. The variable `f` is a function that defines its own local variable `x`, which overshadows the parameter `x`, and it uses `y` from the outer scope, thus both `x` and `y` are utilized. However, `r` does not participate in any computation and remains unused.

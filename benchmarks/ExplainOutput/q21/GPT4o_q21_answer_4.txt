Solution: The unused variables are `r` and the parameter `x` in the `fun x ->` function.

Explanation: 
- The `let r = 2 * y` defines `r`, but it is not used anywhere in the code.
- The function `fun x ->` has a parameter `x`, but it is immediately shadowed by `let x = 42`, making the original `x` unused.

The unused variable in the expression is `f`.

Explanation: In the function `foo`, the variable `r` is calculated but not used in any expressions, hence it is considered unused. The variable `f` holds a function that can take an argument and use it, but `f` itself is not directly invoked or used in the returned value. The only effective output is from calling `f y`, where `y` is used directly in the computation. Therefore, `f` is acknowledged but ultimately not utilized in the context of producing a final result from `foo`.

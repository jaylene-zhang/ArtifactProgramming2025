The unused variable in the given expression is `r`.

**Explanation**:  
- The variable `r` is defined as `let r = 2 * y`, but it is never used anywhere in the function body.
- On the other hand, the variable `f` is used as a function, and `y` is used both in `r`'s definition and in the function `f`.
- The redefined `x` within the `fun x` body is used in the expression `x * y`.

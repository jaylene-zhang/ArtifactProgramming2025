**Solution:**

The unused variable in the expression is `r`.

**Explanation:**

- The variable `r` is defined as `2 * y` but is never used anywhere in the function `foo`.
- The variable `f` is used, and its body uses `x` and `y`.
- Inside the function `f`, the local variable `x` (shadowing the parameter `x`) is used.
- Hence, only `r` is not utilized in the entire code.

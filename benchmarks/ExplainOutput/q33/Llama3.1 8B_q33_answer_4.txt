**Solution:**
```ocaml
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type revolutions = int
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions
```

**Explanation:**

This implementation captures the description because:

* `revolutions` is a type that represents the number of revolutions, which allows for any whole number, including numbers greater than 3, as described in the problem.
* `jump_typ` represents the type of jump, which is a tagged union, and `revolutions` represents the number of revolutions associated with it.
* The `type jump = jump_typ * revolutions` declaration defines a product type, where each value of type `jump` is a pair of a jump type and a number of revolutions.

The correct implementation is:

a) `type revolutions = int`  
`type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow`  
`type jump = jump_typ * revolutions`

Explanation: This implementation correctly captures the different types of jumps and associates them with an integer representing the number of revolutions. The `jump_typ` variant allows for the five types of jumps, while the `revolutions` can be any integer, accommodating both more than three rotations as well as variations like double or triple jumps. Options b) and c) are more restrictive in defining revolutions or do not effectively represent the jumps combined with a variable number of revolutions.

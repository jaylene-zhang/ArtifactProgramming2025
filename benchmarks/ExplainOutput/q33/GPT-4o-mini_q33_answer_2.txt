The correct implementation is:

**a)** 
```ocaml
type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions
```

**Explanation:**
Option (a) captures the essence of the problem. It defines a `revolutions` type as an integer, allowing for any number of rotations to be represented accurately. `jump_typ` captures the different types of jumps, and then the `jump` type combines the jump type with the number of revolutions, allowing for flexibility in representing jumps with varying rotations. Options (b) and (c) are too restrictive and do not accommodate the possibility of various integers as revolutions or introduce unnecessary complexity.

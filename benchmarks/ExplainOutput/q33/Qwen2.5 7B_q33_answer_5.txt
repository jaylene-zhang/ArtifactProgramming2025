Solution: **a)
type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions**

Explanation: This option correctly defines a `revelations` type as a `int`, which can hold the number of rotations for any jump. It also correctly defines a `jump_typ` as an enumeration of the five types of jumps. The `jump` type is a tuple that pairs a `jump_typ` with a `revelations`, allowing for any of the five jumps to be associated with any integer number of revolutions. This structure accurately models the problem statement.

Option b) incorrectly restricts the number of revolutions to only `Double` and `Triple`, which does not cover cases with different numbers of rotations. Option c) incorrectly nests the data types, which does not match the description of a simple pairing of a jump type and its rotations.

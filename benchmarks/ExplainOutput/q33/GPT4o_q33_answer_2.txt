**Solution:** a)
```ocaml
type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions
```

**Explanation:**  
Option (a) best fits the description. This implementation uses a `jump_typ` to denote the type of jump and allows specifying the number of revolutions as an `int`, which supports any number of rotations athletes may perform today. This is flexible and concise, capturing the relationship between jump type and revolutions.  
Option (b) restricts revolutions to `Double` or `Triple`, which does not accommodate more rotations.  
Option (c) is overly complex and does not match the described structure as it introduces recursive constructors unnecessarily.

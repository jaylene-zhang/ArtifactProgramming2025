## Answer:
b) type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type revolutions = Double | Triple
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions

## Explanation:

In option a), the type `revolutions` can be any integer value, not just Double or Triple, which does not capture the specific constraint that the number of revolutions should be limited to "Double" or "Triple".

In option c), each jump type (e.g. Axel, Loop, etc.) has an associated type 'jump', not just an integer revolution. This would allow to store a nested `jump` structure within a `jump`.

Option b) correctly captures the description, separating the jump type (Axel, Lutz, etc.) from the revolution type (Double, Triple, etc.) and combining these two types into a single `jump` type.

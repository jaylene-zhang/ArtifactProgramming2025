**Solution: a**

```
type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions
```

**Explanation:**

- We need to represent the basic jumps (Axel, Lutz, Flip, Loop, Salchow) and the number of revolutions for each jump.
- Option a) correctly defines a general integer for revolutions and pairs it with a type `jump_typ` that contains the basic jump types.
- Option b) incorrectly limits the number of revolutions to only Double and Triple, which does not capture the possibility of more rotations.
- Option c) is unnecessarily complex. It defines each jump as a constructor with a nested jump and an integer, which is not needed since each jump is a single type and the number of revolutions can vary.

**Solution:**

a) `type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions`

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is the most appropriate because:

*   It correctly defines `jump_typ` as a variant type with the allowed jump names.
*   It defines `revolutions` as an integer to represent the number of rotations, allowing for double, triple, and even quadruple jumps.
*   It combines the jump type and revolution count into a single `jump` type using a tuple.

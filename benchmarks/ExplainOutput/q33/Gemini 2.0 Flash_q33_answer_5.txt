**Solution:**

a) `type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions`

**Explanation:**

Option (a) is the most appropriate because:

*   It correctly defines `jump_typ` as a variant type representing the different types of jumps.
*   It defines `revolutions` as an `int` to represent the number of rotations, accommodating double, triple, or even quadruple jumps.
*   It uses a tuple `jump_typ * revolutions` to associate a jump type with its number of revolutions.

Option (b) is incorrect because it limits the number of revolutions to only "Double" and "Triple", which is not flexible enough.

Option (c) is incorrect because it tries to define `jump` recursively and associates an integer with it, which doesn't represent the jump type. It also doesn't seem appropriate to represent the jump type.

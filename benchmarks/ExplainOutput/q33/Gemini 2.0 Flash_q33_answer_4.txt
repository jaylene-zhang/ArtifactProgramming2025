**Solution:**

a) `type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions`

**Explanation:**

This implementation is the most suitable because:

*   It correctly represents the jump type (Axel, Loop, etc.) using a variant type `jump_typ`.
*   It allows for any number of revolutions to be associated with each jump using an integer (`revolutions`).
*   It combines these two pieces of information into a `jump` type, representing a specific jump and its number of revolutions using a tuple.

Option (b) limits the number of revolutions to only "Double" or "Triple", which is not sufficient.

Option (c) is incorrect because it recursively defines the `jump` type, and also unnecessarily associates an integer with a `jump` object, which is not meaningful.

The correct answer is (a).

Explanation: 
Option (a) correctly models jumps in figure skating as described. It defines a `jump_typ` as a variant type with constructors for each kind of jump (Axel, Loop, etc.), and represents the revolutions as an integer. A jump is then a pair of jump type and number of revolutions. This allows for flexibility in the number of revolutions (double, triple, or more) as mentioned in the description.

Option (b) restricts revolutions to only Double and Triple, but the description states that "athletes can go over 3 rotations," so this is too limiting.

Option (c) is recursive and doesn't make sense for the domain - a jump would contain another jump, which isn't how figure skating jumps are structured.

**Solution:**

a) `type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions`

**Explanation:**

This implementation correctly captures the information.

*   `type revolutions = int`: Represents the number of revolutions as an integer.
*   `type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow`: Defines the possible jump types using a variant type.
*   `type jump = jump_typ * revolutions`: Combines the jump type and the number of revolutions into a tuple, representing a specific jump.  For example, `(Loop, 3)` would represent a Triple Loop.

The other options are flawed:

*   b)  Limits revolutions to only "Double" or "Triple", not allowing for single, quad, or other revolution counts.
*   c)  Is recursive and doesn't represent the revolutions as a specific integer value for each jump type. It also unnecessarily duplicates the jump types in each variant.

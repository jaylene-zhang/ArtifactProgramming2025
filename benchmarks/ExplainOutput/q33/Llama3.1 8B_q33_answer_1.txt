### Solution

```ocaml
type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = 
  | Axel
  | Loop
  | Lutz
  | Flip
  | Salchow
type jump = 
  jump_typ * revolutions
```

### Explanation

The solution uses a sum type for `jump_typ` to encode the allowed jumps, and a separate type `revolutions` to represent the number of rotations. The `jump` type is then defined as a product type of `jump_typ` and `revolutions`, which captures the idea of a jump with a specific type and a number of rotations. This implementation is concise and easy to understand, and it allows for the addition of new jump types and revolution values in the future.

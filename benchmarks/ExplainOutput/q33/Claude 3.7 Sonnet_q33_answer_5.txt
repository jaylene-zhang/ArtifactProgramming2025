Answer: a) type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions

This is the correct implementation because:
- It defines a type for jump_typ that includes all the allowed jumps (Axel, Lutz, Flip, Loop, Salchow)
- It represents revolutions as an integer, which allows for any number of rotations (double, triple, or more)
- It models a jump as a pair of jump type and number of revolutions

Option b) restricts revolutions to only Double and Triple, which contradicts the description that "today's athletes can go over 3 rotations."

Option c) is incorrect because it defines jumps recursively (each jump contains another jump), which doesn't match the description and would lead to infinite types.

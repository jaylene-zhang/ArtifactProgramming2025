**Correct Answer**: 1 and 4

---

### Explanation:

1. **Option 1**:
   - The function stores the result of `prime_fact x` in a variable `p` before applying the recursive function `test`.
   - This ensures that `prime_fact x` is computed only once, and the result is reused.
   - ✅ Computes `prime_fact x` **once**.

2. **Option 2**:
   - Here, `prime_fact x` is recomputed for every recursive call to `check`.
   - If the input list is large, this leads to multiple calls to `prime_fact x`.
   - ❌ Computes `prime_fact x` **multiple times**.

3. **Option 3**:
   - The function applies `prime_fact x` inside the lambda function passed to `List.exists`.
   - This means `prime_fact x` is recalculated for every element in the list.
   - ❌ Computes `prime_fact x` **multiple times**.

4. **Option 4**:
   - Similar to Option 1, `prime_fact x` is computed once at the beginning (stored in `p`) and reused with `List.exists`.
   - ✅ Computes `prime_fact x` **once**.

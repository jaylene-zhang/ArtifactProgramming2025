**1 and 4** 

Explanation: 
These implementations only compute `prime_fact x` once. In option 1, `prime_fact x` is computed and stored in `p`, then the recursive function `test` checks if `p` is in the list. In option 4, `prime_fact x` is computed and stored in `p`, then `List.exists` checks if `p` is in the list. Options 2 and 3 compute `prime_fact x` potentially multiple times.

Solution: 1 and 4

Implementation 1 computes `prime_fact x` once outside the recursive loop and stores the result in variable `p`. Then it uses `p` in each comparison without recomputing it.

Implementation 4 also computes `prime_fact x` once and stores it in variable `p`, then uses this value in the anonymous function passed to `List.exists`.

Implementation 2 recomputes `prime_fact x` in each recursive call when comparing with a new element of the list.

Implementation 3 recomputes `prime_fact x` for each element in the list because the anonymous function passed to `List.exists` calls it each time.

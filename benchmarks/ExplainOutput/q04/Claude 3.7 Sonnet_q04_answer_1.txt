Solution: Options 1 and 4 compute prime_fact only once.

Explanation:
To determine which implementations compute prime_fact only once, we need to examine when this function is called in each implementation.

Option 1: Computes prime_fact once at the beginning and stores the result in p, then uses this value throughout the recursive test function.

Option 2: Computes prime_fact on every recursive call, so it could be computed multiple times.

Option 3: Computes prime_fact once but passes it directly to List.exists, where it's used in every comparison, so it's computed multiple times.

Option 4: Computes prime_fact once and stores the result in p, then passes a function that uses this stored value to List.exists.

Therefore, options 1 and 4 are the correct answers because they compute prime_fact exactly once.

**Solution and Explanation**

The correct answer is option 3.

Explanation:

* Option 1: This implementation recomputes the prime_factorization of `x` in each recursive call of the `test` function, which is unnecessary and inefficient.
* Option 2: This implementation also recomputes the prime_factorization of `x` in each recursive call, which is unnecessary.
* Option 4: This implementation is close, but not quite correct. The `let p` clause should be inside the `check_prime_factors` function, not before the `let check_prime_factors x = ...` line.
* Option 3: This implementation correctly computes the prime_factorization of `x` only once before starting the iteration over the list, and uses the `List.exists` function to check if the prime_factorization is present in the list.

**Solution:**

1. 

```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l = 
  let p = prime_fact x in
  let rec test l = match l with
  | [] -> false
  | y::ys -> y = p || test ys
  in test l
```

**Explanation:**

- This solution computes `prime_fact x` once and stores it in `p`.
- The `test` function then iterates over the list `l`, checking if each element matches `p`.
- This ensures that `prime_fact` is only computed once, as required.

2. 

```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l = 
  match l with
  | [] -> false
  | y::ys -> y = prime_fact x || check x ys
```

**Explanation:**

- This solution recomputes `prime_fact x` for each element in the list.
- This does not meet the requirement of computing `prime_fact` only once.

3. 

```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l = 
  List.exists (fun e -> e = prime_fact x) l
```

**Explanation:**

- This recomputes `prime_fact x` for each element in the list.
- This does not meet the requirement of computing `prime_fact` only once.

4. 

```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x = 
  let p = prime_fact x in 
  List.exists (fun e -> e = p) 
```

**Explanation:**

- This solution is syntactically incorrect as it does not take a list `l` as an argument.
- It computes `prime_fact x` once but misses the `l` parameter entirely.

The correct choice is option 1.

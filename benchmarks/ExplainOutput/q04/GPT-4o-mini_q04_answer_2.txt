The correct implementations that compute the function `prime_fact` only once are:

1. 
```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l = let p = prime_fact x in
let rec test l = match l with
| [] -> false
| y::ys -> y = p || test ys
in test l
```

4. 
```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x =
let p = prime_fact x in List.exists (fun e -> e = p)
```

### Explanation:
- Option 1 computes `prime_fact x` once and stores the result in `p`, which is then checked against each list in the provided list.
- Option 4 also computes `prime_fact x` once and uses it in the `List.exists` function to check for existence in the list.

Options 2 and 3 compute `prime_fact x` multiple times, which does not satisfy the requirement of computing it only once. Option 2 calls `prime_fact` repeatedly in the recursion, and option 3 calls it inside the `List.exists` function, thus evaluating it for each element.

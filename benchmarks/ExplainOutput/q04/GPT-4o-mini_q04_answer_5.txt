The implementations that compute `prime_fact` only once are:

1. **Implementation 1**
2. **Implementation 3**
3. **Implementation 4**

### Explanation:

1. **Implementation 1**: This implementation computes `prime_fact x` once, storing it in `p`. The recursive function `test` checks if `p` is equal to any of the lists in `l`.

2. **Implementation 3**: This implementation uses `List.exists` and computes `prime_fact x` within the call. This implementation only checks for equality with the result of `prime_fact` but involves a single evaluation since `List.exists` triggers it only once.

3. **Implementation 4**: This implementation also computes `prime_fact x` once and stores it in `p`, then checks if this value exists in the list using `List.exists`.

**Implementation 2** is incorrect because it computes `prime_fact x` multiple times as it is directly calling it inside the match without storing the result.

Solution: 1 and 4

Explanation:
1. This solution computes `prime_fact x` only once and uses its result in the recursive check.
4. This solution also computes `prime_fact x` only once and uses its result for the `List.exists` comparison.

Options 2 and 3 compute `prime_fact x` in every iteration of the list, leading to repeated computations.

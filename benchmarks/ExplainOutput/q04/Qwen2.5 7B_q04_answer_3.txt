Solution: Option 1

```
let check_prime_factors x l = 
  let p = prime_fact x in
  let rec test l = 
    match l with 
    | [] -> false
    | y::ys -> y = p || test ys 
  in test l
```

Explanation: 

- In this solution, `prime_fact x` is computed once and stored in `p`.
- The function `test` is a recursive helper function used to check if `p` exists in the list `l`.
- The function `check_prime_factors` is tail-recursive and does not recompute `prime_fact x`, resulting in better performance as the prime factorization is computed only once.

Option 2 is incorrect because `prime_fact x` is recomputed for each element in the list.

Option 3 is incorrect because it recomputes `prime_fact x` for each element, which is inefficient.

Option 4 is incorrect because `check_prime_factors` is defined without an argument list, which is syntactically incorrect.

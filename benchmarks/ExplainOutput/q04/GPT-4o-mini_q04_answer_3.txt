The implementation that only computes the function `prime_fact` once is:

**4.** 
```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x =
let p = prime_fact x in List.exists (fun e -> e = p)
```

**Explanation:**
In this implementation, `prime_fact x` is called once and stored in the variable `p`. The function `List.exists` is then used to check if this computed value `p` matches any of the lists in the input list of factorizations. This avoids redundant calls to `prime_fact` and thus is the most efficient choice in terms of function calls. The other options either directly call `prime_fact` multiple times or do not structure the code to avoid this redundancy.

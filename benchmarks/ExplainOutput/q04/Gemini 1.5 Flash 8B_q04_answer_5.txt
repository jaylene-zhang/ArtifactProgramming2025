The correct answer is **3**.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l =
List.exists (fun e -> e = prime_fact x) l
```

**Explanation:**

Option 3, `List.exists`, directly checks if the list `l` contains an element (`e`) that is equal to the prime factorization of `x` (computed by `prime_fact x`).  It does this in a single pass through the input list, computing the factorization exactly once.  Options 1 and 2 both compute the factorization multiple times within the recursive loops. Option 4 has a syntax error.


Options 1 and 2 incorrectly recompute `prime_fact x` repeatedly within the recursive calls or conditions. Option 4 is incomplete.  Only option 3 calculates `prime_fact` once and then checks its presence in `l`.

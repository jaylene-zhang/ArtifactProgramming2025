Solution: 1, 3

Explanation:

* **Option 1:**  Calculates `prime_fact(x)` once (`p = prime_fact x`).  Then, it iterates through the input list `l`, comparing each element `y` to the pre-calculated `p`.

* **Option 3:** Uses `List.exists`, which iterates through the list and applies a function (in this case, checking `e = prime_fact x`). Crucially, `prime_fact(x)` is calculated *once* outside the iteration.

* **Option 2:**  Incorrect. It calls `prime_fact(x)` in every recursive step inside the `check` function.

* **Option 4:** Incorrect.  It has a syntax error (missing arguments for `List.exists`). Also, it computes `prime_fact(x)` only once, but the function it defines is missing the input list.


Option 1 efficiently computes `p` (the prime factorization of `x`) *once*, then repeatedly compares *that* result against each possible factorization in the input list.  Option 3 also computes `p` just once and leverages the optimized `List.exists` function to check for its presence.  Both options meet the requirement of computing `prime_fact` only once.

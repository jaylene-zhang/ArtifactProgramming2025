**Correct Solution:** 
```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l =
  let p = prime_fact x in
  List.exists (fun e -> e = p) l
```
**Explanation:** This implementation only calls the `prime_fact` function once, assigning the result to `p` and then checks if `p` is present in the list `l`. This avoids repeated calls to `prime_fact` for each element in the list, which is more efficient. 

Alternatively, the original code implementation 1 also only calls prime_fact once but it does not use a standard library function like List.exists. 

```ocaml
let check_prime_factors x l = 
  let p = prime_fact x in
  let rec test l = match l with
  | [] -> false
  | y::ys -> y = p || test ys
  in test l
```
The other options have multiple calls to `prime_fact`, which is inefficient.

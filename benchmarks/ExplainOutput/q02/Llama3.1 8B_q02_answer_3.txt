**Solution**
```ocaml
let rec repeat (f : 'a -> 'a) : 'a = f (repeat f)
```

**Explanation**: We can fill in the hole with `'a -> 'a` as the type of `f`, because `f` needs to take any type `'a` and return `'a`. This is the only way for the recursive application of `f` to be well-typed.

Additionally, `'a` can be used as the return type of `repeat`, since `repeat f` has type `'a` due to self-types.

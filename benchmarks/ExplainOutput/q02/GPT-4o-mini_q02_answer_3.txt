The most general types to fill in are:

1. **(unit -> 'a)**
2. **'a**

So the complete function is:

```ocaml
let rec repeat (f : unit -> 'a) : 'a = f (repeat f)
```

**Explanation:** 

- The function `f` takes no arguments (indicated by `unit`) and returns a value of type `'a`. 
- The expression `repeat f` calls `repeat` recursively, so it needs to fulfill the type of `f`, which is `unit -> 'a`. 
- Therefore, the return type of `repeat` must match the result type of `f`, which is `'a`. The overall structure is well-typed, and it correctly indicates that `repeat` can produce any type `'a` based on the function `f`.

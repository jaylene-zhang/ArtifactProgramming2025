The most general types for the holes are:

```ocaml
let rec repeat (f : 'a -> 'a) : 'a -> 'a = f (repeat f)
```

Explanation:
- `'a -> 'a`: This indicates that `f` is a function that takes any type `'a` and returns a value of type `'a`.
- `'a -> 'a`: This indicates that `repeat` is a function that takes any type `'a` and returns a function of type `('a -> 'a)`. 

This type system ensures that `f` can be any function that accepts and returns the same type, and `repeat` compiles correctly by recursively calling `f` with `repeat f` as its argument.

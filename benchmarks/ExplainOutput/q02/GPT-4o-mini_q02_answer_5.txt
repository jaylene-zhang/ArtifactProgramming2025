The most general types to fill in are:

**First Hole:** `('a -> 'a)`  
**Second Hole:** `'a`

So the complete line of code now reads:

```ocaml
let rec repeat (f : 'a -> 'a) : 'a = f (repeat f)
```

### Explanation:
The function `repeat` takes a parameter `f` of type `('a -> 'a)` which means that it accepts a function that takes an argument of type `'a` and returns a value of the same type. The body of `repeat` calls `f` with the result of `repeat f`, meaning `repeat` also needs to return a value of type `'a`. Thus, the function type matches the return type, allowing for proper type consistency. In this context, `repeat f` produces a value of type `'a`, which is also the argument type needed for `f`.

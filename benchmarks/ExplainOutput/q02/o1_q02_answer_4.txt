Solution:
• f has type 'a -> 'a  
• repeat has type ('a -> 'a) -> 'a  

Explanation (concise):  
Because repeat f is passed as the argument to f and is also the result of calling repeat f, f’s input and output types must coincide. Unifying these forces f : 'a -> 'a and repeat : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a. The definition is well-typed (though non-terminating).

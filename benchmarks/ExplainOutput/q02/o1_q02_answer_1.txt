Solution:  
  let rec repeat (f : 'a -> 'a) : 'a = f (repeat f)

Explanation:  
1) The call repeat f must be passed as an argument to f, so f : 'a -> 'a.  
2) Applying f to repeat f yields a result of type 'a, so repeat has type ('a -> 'a) -> 'a.  
3) Although this diverges at runtime, it is still well-typed in OCaml.

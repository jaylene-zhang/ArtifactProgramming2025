```ocaml
let rec repeat (f : 'a -> 'a) : 'a -> 'a = f (repeat f)
```

Explanation:
- The function `f` is a function that takes an argument of type `'a` and returns a value of type `'a`. Therefore, its type is `'a -> 'a`.
- The `repeat` function takes this function `f` and returns a new function that also takes an argument of type `'a` and returns a value of type `'a`. Therefore, the overall type of `repeat` is `'a -> 'a`. 

This results in a type signature where `repeat` is a function that takes an `'a -> 'a` function and returns an `'a -> 'a` function. The choice of `'a` is generic, meaning it can be any type.

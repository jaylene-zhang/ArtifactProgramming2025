```ocaml
let rec repeat (f : 'a -> 'a) : 'a = f (repeat f)
```

**Explanation:**  
The function `repeat` takes a function `f` that takes an argument of type `'a` and returns a value of the same type `'a`. The recursive call `repeat f` must also produce a value that serves as the input to `f`, which is why the type of `repeat` itself must match that of `f`. Thus, the most general types to fill in are `'a -> 'a` for `f` and `'a` for the return type. This allows the recursive structure to maintain type consistency.

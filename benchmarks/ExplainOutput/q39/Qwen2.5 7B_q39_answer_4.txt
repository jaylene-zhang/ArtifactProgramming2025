```ocaml
let toInt f = 
  try 
    let rec helper x = 
      let y = f x in 
      if x = y then 
        failwith ""
      else 
        1 + (helper y) 
    in 
    helper (Obj.magic f)
  with _ -> 0
```

Explanation:
- The function `toInt` needs to determine how many times the function `f` applies itself.
- We use a recursive helper function that keeps applying `f` to its argument until `f` no longer changes the value.
- The `Obj.magic` is used to convert the function `f` into an object, allowing us to use it in the recursive helper function.
- If the recursion hits a point where `f x` equals `x`, it means the number of applications is known, and the recursion stops. We then count the number of recursive calls made.
- The `try...with _ -> 0` part handles the case where the recursion never stabilizes, which should not happen given the problem constraints, but it is good practice to handle failures gracefully.

Solution:
```ocaml
let toInt f =
  let rec count n =
    if n = 0 then 0
    else (fun x -> x) >>= f >>= count (n - 1)
  in
  count
```
Explanation:
We define a helper function `count` that takes an integer `n` as argument. If `n` is 0, `count` returns 0. Otherwise, it applies the identity function `(fun x -> x)` to the result of applying `f` to the result of recursively calling `count` with `n-1`. This effectively applies `f` `n` times, and the `>>=` operator composes these applications.

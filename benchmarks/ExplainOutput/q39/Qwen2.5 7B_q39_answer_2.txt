```
let toInt f = 
  let rec helper acc g = 
    match g () with
    | x -> if f x = x then acc else helper (acc + 1) (fun () -> g ())
  in helper 0 (fun () -> f)
```

Explanation:
- The `toInt` function takes a function `f` and returns the number of times `f` is applied to its argument.
- We use a helper recursive function `helper` that takes an accumulator `acc` and a function `g`.
- The `match` statement checks if `f x = x`, which acts as a base case (when `f` doesn't modify `x` anymore, it means the function was applied a certain number of times, and we return the accumulator).
- If `f x` is not equal to `x`, we increment the accumulator and recursively call `helper` with the incremented accumulator and a nested function `fun () -> g ()` that ensures `g` is only called when needed (to simulate the original behavior of `create`).
- The initial call to `helper` starts with an accumulator set to 0 and a function inside `g` that will eventually call `f` once.

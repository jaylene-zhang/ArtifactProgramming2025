```ocaml
let toInt f =
  let counter = ref 0 in
  let inc_counter _ = counter := !counter + 1; () in
  f (fun _ -> inc_counter (); ()) 0;
  !counter
```

Explanation: This function works by creating a counter that tracks how many times a function is applied. When we call `f` with a function that increases the counter each time it's called and a dummy value `0`, the counter will be incremented exactly the number of times the function is applied. We then return the final counter value, which gives us the desired result.

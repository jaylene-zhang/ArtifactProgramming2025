```ocaml
let toInt f =
  let counter = ref 0 in
  f (fun _ -> counter := !counter + 1) () ;
  !counter
```

This solution works by:
1. Creating a mutable counter initialized to 0
2. Passing two arguments to the function f:
   - A function that increments the counter whenever it's called
   - A unit value () as the second argument (x)
3. The function f will apply the increment function some number of times
4. Finally, we return the counter value, which equals the number of applications

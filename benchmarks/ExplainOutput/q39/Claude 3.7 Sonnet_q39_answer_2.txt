```ocaml
let toInt f = 
  let counter = ref 0 in
  let inc _ = counter := !counter + 1; () in
  f (fun _ -> inc (); ()) 0;
  !counter
```

This solution works by using a mutable counter to track how many times the function is applied. We pass the function `f` a simple incrementing function and a dummy value (0). When `f` applies the function, our counter increases. After `f` completes, we return the final count.

```OCaml
let rec toInt f =
  let rec aux f x n =
    match f x with
    | x' -> if x' == x then n else aux f x' (n + 1)
  in
  aux f (fun x -> x) 0
```

**Explanation:**

The `toInt` function's goal is to determine how many times a function `f` is applied to an argument.  It does this via a recursive helper function `aux`.  

1. **`aux f x n`:** This helper function takes the function `f`, the current argument `x`, and the current count `n`.
2. **`match f x with ...`:** It applies the function `f` to the argument `x`. Importantly, this is the crucial step for counting applications.
3. **`if x' == x then n else aux f x' (n + 1)`:**  The `match` expression returns the result of applying `f` to `x`. If the result is the same as the original `x`, it means the function hasn't been applied at all (base case), so `n` is returned. Otherwise, the recursion continues with the new argument, `x'`, and an incremented count, `n + 1`.

Crucially, the outer `toInt` function initializes the `aux` function with the original function and the identity function  `(fun x -> x)` as the initial argument. This ensures the counting starts correctly for different input functions.  The initial count `n` is set to 0.


**Example Usage (Illustrative):**

```OCaml
let f x = x + 1

let a= toInt (fun f x -> x)
let b= toInt (fun f x -> f x)
let c = toInt (fun f x ->f (f x))
let d = toInt (fun f x -> f(f (f x)));;

let _ =  print_int a;; (* Output: 0 *)
let _ = print_int b;; (* output: 1 *)
let _ = print_int c ;; (* output: 2 *)
let _ = print_int d;; (* output: 3 *)
```

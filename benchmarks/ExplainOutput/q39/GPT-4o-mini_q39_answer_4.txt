```ocaml
let toInt f =
  let rec count n x =
    match f (fun y -> count (n + 1) y) x with
    | _ -> n
  in
  count 0
```

**Explanation:**
The `toInt` function takes a function `f` and utilizes a recursive helper function `count` to keep track of how many times `f` is applied to its input. It starts counting from 0 and increments `n` each time `f` applies itself to an argument. The recursion continues until `f` returns a value without further application, at which point it returns the count of applications.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let toInt f =
  let rec aux n =
    if f (fun x -> x) (Obj.magic ()) == Obj.magic () then n else aux (n + 1)
  in
  aux 0
```

**Explanation:**

The `toInt` function aims to determine how many times a function `f` effectively applies a function to its input.

1.  **`aux` function:** A recursive helper function `aux` is defined to iterate and count the applications. It takes an integer `n` as input, representing the current count.

2.  **Base Case:**

    *   `f (fun x -> x) (Obj.magic ()) == Obj.magic ()` serves as the base-case condition.
    *   It tests if applying `f` with the identity function `(fun x -> x)` and some initial value (obtained via `Obj.magic ()`) results in the exact same initial value. `Obj.magic` is used to bypass type checking as the argument for `f` needs to be of some type `'a`, and since we care about how many times the function inside `f` are applied, we do not care about the actual type of the argument of `f`. If it does, it means `f` effectively applied the identity function 0 times, so we return the accumulator `n`.
    *   The accumulator starts at 0.

3.  **Recursive Step:** If the base case is not met (i.e., `f` does apply the function at least once), the function calls itself recursively with an incremented counter (`n + 1`).

In essence, the function keeps incrementing a counter as long as `f` composed with the identity function does not simply return the initial value.

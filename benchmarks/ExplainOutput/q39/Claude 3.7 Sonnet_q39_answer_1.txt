```ocaml
let toInt f = 
  let counter = ref 0 in
  let rec dummy x = 
    incr counter; 
    x 
  in
  f dummy 0;
  !counter
```

This solution works by:
1. Creating a counter that tracks how many times a function is called
2. Defining a dummy function that increments the counter and returns its argument
3. Applying f to the dummy function and a base value 0
4. Returning the final counter value

When f applies the dummy function n times, the counter will reach n.

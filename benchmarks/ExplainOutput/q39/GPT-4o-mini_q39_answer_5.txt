```ocaml
let rec toInt f = 
  if f (fun y -> y) = f then 0 
  else 1 + toInt (fun y -> f f y)
```

Explanation: 
The function `toInt` uses recursion to determine how many times the function `f` needs to be applied to produce the identity function (which simply returns its input). It checks if applying `f` to the identity function returns `f` itself, indicating zero applications needed. If not, it counts one application and recursively calls `toInt`, applying `f` to itself again. This continues until it identifies the depth of applications that brings it back to the identity function, effectively counting how many times `f` is applied.

**Result:** `(1, 3, [2; 3; 4], [2; 4; 6])`

Explanation:

**Binding Stack:**
```
x = 1
inc ----> x -> c (c = ref 0)
observe ----> () -> c (c = ref 0)

x = 1
inc' ----> y -> c (c = ref 1), x
x = 2 ( locally bound in inc' )
c = ref 1
c = ref 0
```

The key points to note are:

* `x` is initially bound to 1.
* `inc` function captures the outer `c` and `x` is not captured, it's the argument of the function.
* When `List.map inc l` is called, `x` in `inc x` is the argument, not the outer `x`. So, `inc` increments `c` and returns the incremented argument.
* `inc'` captures the local `x` (which is `x + 1 = 2`) and a new `c`. So, when `inc'` is called, it increments its local `c` and adds the local `x` and the argument.

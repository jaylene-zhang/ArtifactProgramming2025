The final result of running the given OCaml program is: 
```
(2, 3, [2; 3; 4], [3; 4; 5])
```

### Explanation using binding stack diagram:

1. **Initial Bindings**: 
   - `c` is a reference initialized to `0`. 
   - `l` becomes `[3; 2; 1]` after reversing `[1; 2; 3]`.
   - `observe` is a function that returns the current value of `!c`.
   - `x` is set to `1`.

2. **Function inc**:
   - `inc x` increments the value of `c` by `1` each time it's called and returns `x + 1`. 
   - This means calling `inc` for each element in `l` results in `c` being `3` by the end (incremented once for each element).

3. **List.map inc**:
   - The mapping results in `[2; 3; 4]`, as it applies `inc` to each element in `l` (which is `[3; 2; 1]`):
     - `inc 3` gives `4` (c increments to `1`)
     - `inc 2` gives `3` (c increments to `2`)
     - `inc 1` gives `2` (c increments to `3`)

4. **New Local `c`**:
   - Inside the binding of `inc'`, a new `c` is created with an initial value of `0` and the local `x` is incremented to `2`.

5. **Function inc'**:
   - `inc'` increments this new `c` and provides a result proportional to its own `y` plus the new `x`.
   
6. **List.map inc'**:
   - The mapping again on `l` results in `[3; 4; 5]`:
     - `inc' 3` gives `3 + 1 + 2` = `6` (new `c` increments to `1`)
     - `inc' 2` gives `2 + 1 + 2` = `5` (new `c` increments to `2`)
     - `inc' 1` gives `1 + 1 + 2` = `4` (new `c` increments to `3`)

7. **Final Outputs**:
   - After all calculations:
     - `observe ()` references the original `c`, which is `3`.
     - Result outputs are as follows:
       - The final tuple is `(2, 3, [2; 3; 4], [3; 4; 5])`. 

Thus, the output reflects the results of the computations done using the `inc` and `inc'` functions applied to the reversed input list `l`.

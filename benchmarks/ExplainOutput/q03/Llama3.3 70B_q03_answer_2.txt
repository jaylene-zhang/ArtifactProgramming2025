**Final result: (1, 6, [2; 3; 4], [6; 7; 8])**

Binding stack diagram:

* `x = 1`
* `inc ----> x -> c, x+1` 
  * `c = 0` (initially)
* `inc' ----> y -> c, x, y` 
  * `c = ref 0` (locally scoped)
  * `x = 2` (locally scoped, because of let x = x + 1)
* `observe ----> () -> c`
  * `c = 0` (initially)
* `l = [3; 2; 1]` (due to `List.rev [1;2;3]`)

Explanation: 
The `inc` function increases the global `c` variable each time it is called. 
When `List.map inc l` is called, it applies `inc` to each element of `l`, incrementing `c` and adding 1 to each element. 
The `inc'` function also has its own local `c` and `x` variables. 
The `observe` function returns the current value of the global `c` variable, which has been incremented 6 times: 3 times when `List.map inc l` was called and 3 times when `List.map inc' l` was called.

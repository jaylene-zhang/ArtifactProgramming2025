Solution:
(1, 3, [4; 3; 2], [6; 6; 6])

Explanation (with short binding diagram):

1) Outside inc':  
   c → ref(0) initially  
   l → [3; 2; 1]  (the reversed list)  
   x → 1  
   inc → fun x -> (c := !c + 1; x + 1)  

   After List.map inc l:  
     inc 3 sets c = 1, returns 4  
     inc 2 sets c = 2, returns 3  
     inc 1 sets c = 3, returns 2  
   ml = [4; 3; 2]  
   observe () reads !c = 3  

2) Inside inc' block:  
   c → ref(0) (new reference)  
   x → 2 (shadowing the outer x)  
   inc' → fun y -> (c := !c + 1; !c + y + x)  

   After List.map inc' l:  
     inc'(3) → c=1, returns 6  
     inc'(2) → c=2, returns 6  
     inc'(1) → c=3, returns 6  
   ml' = [6; 6; 6]  

Hence final result: (1, 3, [4; 3; 2], [6; 6; 6]).

Binding stack diagram:

c = 4
```


Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how the program is evaluated:


1. `let c = ref 0` : initializes a reference cell `c` with value 0.
2. `let l = List.rev [1;2;3]` : computes the reverse of the list `[1;2;3]`, resulting in `[3;2;1]`.
3. `let observe () = !c` : defines a function `observe` that returns the current value of `c`.
4. `let x = 1` : initializes a variable `x` with value 1.
5. `let inc x = c:= !c+1 ; x+1` : defines a function `inc` that increments `c` and returns `x+1`.
6. `let ml = List.map inc l` : applies `inc` to each element of `l`, resulting in `[2;3;4]`. This also increments `c` three times, making `c` equal to 3.
7. `let inc’ = (let c = ref 0 in let x = x + 1 in fun y -> c := !c+1 ; !c+y+x)` : defines a new function `inc'`. This function has its own local `c` and `x`, which shadows the outer `c` and `x`. The local `x` is initialized to `x + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`.
8. `let ml’ = List.map inc’ l` : applies `inc'` to each element of `l`, resulting in `[6;7;8]`. Note that the local `c` in `inc'` is incremented once for each application, and the outer `c` is not affected. However, the outer `c` is already 3 because of the previous applications of `inc`.
9. The final expression `(x,observe () , ml, ml’)`: returns the values of `x` (1), `observe ()` (which returns the current value of `c`, which is 3 + 3 = 6 because `inc'` has been called 3 times, but these increments are not reflected in the final `observe` call, where `c` is 3, and then the value of `c` is incremented one more time by `inc` functions at `List.map`), `ml` ([2;3;4]), and `ml'` ([6;7;8]). After `x` and `ml` are computed, two more increments happen in the `inc` function used in `ml'` but they are not seen by the outer `observe`, but they are seen by the `observe` called at the end. Therefore, we have `x`, `observe ()`, `ml`, `ml'` which are `1`, `4`, `[2;3;4]`, `[6;7;8]`.

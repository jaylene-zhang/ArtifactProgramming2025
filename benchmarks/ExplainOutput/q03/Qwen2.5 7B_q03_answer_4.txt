```ocaml
(x, observe (), ml, ml')
```

**Solution:**

- `x` is `1` (initially defined).
- `observe ()` evaluates to `0` (referencing `!c` which is initialized to `0`).
- `ml` is `[2; 3; 4]` (the result of `List.map inc l` where `inc` increments `c` to `1` initially and then the value of `l` is processed).
- `ml’` is `[2; 3; 4]` (the result of `List.map inc’ l` where `inc’` also increments `c` twice and then processes the values of `l`).

**Explanation using the binding stack diagram:**

Initial state:
```
c = 0
l = [1; 2; 3]
x = 1
```

After defining `inc` and `inc’`:
```
c = 0
l = [1; 2; 3]
x = 1
```

After evaluating `ml = List.map inc l`:
```
c = 1
l = [1; 2; 3]
x = 1
ml = [2; 3; 4]
```

After evaluating `inc’` and `ml’ = List.map inc’ l`:
```
c = 3   (c is incremented twice in `inc’`)
l = [1; 2; 3]
x = 1
ml’ = [2; 3; 4]
```

Finally:
```
(x, observe (), ml, ml') = (1, 0, [2; 3; 4], [2; 3; 4])
```

So:
- `x = 1`
- `observe () = 0` (value of `!c` after `c := 0`)
- `ml = [2; 3; 4]`
- `ml’ = [2; 3; 4]`

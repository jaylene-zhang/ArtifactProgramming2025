No, the program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

Explanation: In the given implementation, `ackermann x` is computed in every recursive call to `add_ack`, including the initial call. This results in multiple evaluations of `ackermann x` for each `add_ack x l` call, which is inefficient.

No, the program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

Explanation:
- The function `add_ack` is applied at each element of the list `l`, and `ackermann x` is recomputed in each recursive call.
- Therefore, `ackermann x` is computed multiple times, not just once, as it is called in each recursive step.

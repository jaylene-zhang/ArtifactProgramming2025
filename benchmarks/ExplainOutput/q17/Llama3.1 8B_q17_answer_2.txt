**Solution:**
```ocaml
let add_ack x l = match l with
  | [] -> []
  | y::ys -> (match ys with
              | [] -> [ackermann x + y]
              | _ -> (ackermann x + y) :: add_ack x ys)
```

**Explanation:** In the original code, the function `ackermann x` is computed at each step of the recursion when `ys` is non-empty. However, in the corrected code, we use pattern matching with guard to ensure that `ackermann x` is only computed when `ys` is empty. This is because when `ys` is empty, the `(ackermann x + y)` expression is guaranteed to be evaluated to a list, avoiding unnecessary computation.

```ocaml
let rec add_ack x l = match l with
  | [] -> []
  | y::ys -> ((ackermann x) + y) :: add_ack x ys
```

**Solution:** No

**Explanation:**

The function `add_ack` recursively calls `ackermann x` for each element in the list `l`. This means `ackermann x` is computed repeatedly for each element in the list.  It's not memoised, so the computation happens each time the function encounters an element in the list.  Therefore, `ackermann x` is computed multiple times.

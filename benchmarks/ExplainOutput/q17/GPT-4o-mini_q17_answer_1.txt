The provided code does **not** compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

**Explanation**: In the function `add_ack`, `ackermann x` is called every time the recursive function is invoked, which means it is computed anew for each element in the list `l`. This leads to multiple evaluations of `ackermann x`, resulting in inefficiency, especially if the list `l` is long. To compute `ackermann x` only once, you could store the result in a variable:

```ocaml
let rec add_ack x l =
  let ack_value = ackermann x in
  match l with
  | [] -> []
  | y::ys -> (ack_value + y) :: add_ack x ys
```

This modification ensures that `ackermann x` is calculated once and reused throughout the function's execution.

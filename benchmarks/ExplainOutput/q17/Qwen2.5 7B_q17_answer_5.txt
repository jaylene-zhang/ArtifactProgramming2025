No, the program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

**Solution:**
```ocaml
let rec add_ack x l = match l with
  | [] -> []
  | y::ys -> (let ack_val = ackermann x in (ack_val + y) :: add_ack x ys)
```

**Explanation:**
The original code calls `ackermann x` on each recursive call to `add_ack`, leading to multiple calls. By defining `ack_val = ackermann x` once and using it, we ensure `ackermann x` is computed only once for each function call.

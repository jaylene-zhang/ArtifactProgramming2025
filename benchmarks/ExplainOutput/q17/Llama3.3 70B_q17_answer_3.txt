**No**

The given program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once. In each recursive call to `add_ack`, `ackermann x` is recomputed. This results in exponential computation of `ackermann x` for each element in the list, leading to inefficiency. To optimize this, `ackermann x` should be computed once and the result stored in a variable, which can then be reused in each recursive call.

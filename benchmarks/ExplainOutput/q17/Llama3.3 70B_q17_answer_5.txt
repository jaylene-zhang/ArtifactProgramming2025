**No**

Explanation: The function `add_ack` recursively calls itself for each element in the list, and in each recursive call, it computes `ackermann x`. This results in `ackermann x` being computed multiple times, which is not efficient. To achieve the goal of computing `ackermann x` at most once, the result of `ackermann x` should be computed only once and then reused in the recursive calls.

No, the program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

**Explanation:** In the given implementation, `ackermann x` is called every time `add_ack` is executed, which will happen once for each element of the list `l`. This means if `l` has multiple elements, the `ackermann x` function will be repeatedly computed for each element, leading to redundant calculations. To ensure it computes `ackermann x` only once, you could store the result in a local variable before the recursion. Here's a revised version:

```ocaml
let rec add_ack x l =
  let ack_value = ackermann x in
  match l with
  | [] -> []
  | y::ys -> (ack_value + y) :: add_ack x ys
``` 

In this modified version, `ackermann x` is computed only once and reused.

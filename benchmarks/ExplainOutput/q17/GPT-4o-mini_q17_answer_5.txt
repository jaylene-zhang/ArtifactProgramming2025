No, the program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

Explanation: In the given implementation of `add_ack`, the expression `(ackermann x)` is evaluated for each element in the list `l`. Since this expression is inside the recursive call, whenever `add_ack` processes a new element in the list, it re-evaluates `ackermann x`, leading to multiple computations of the same `ackermann x` value if the list has more than one element. To compute it only once, you could store the result of `ackermann x` in a variable and reuse that value throughout the list processing, like this:

```ocaml
let add_ack x l =
  let ack_value = ackermann x in
  List.map (fun y -> ack_value + y) l
```

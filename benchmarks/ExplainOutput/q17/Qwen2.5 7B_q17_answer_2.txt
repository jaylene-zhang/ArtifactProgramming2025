No, the program does not compute `ackermann x` at most once for a function call `add_ack x l`.

**Solution:**
No

**Explanation:**
The function `add_ack` calls `ackermann x` in every recursive call of `add_ack x ys`. This means `ackermann x` is computed multiple times for each element in the list, not just once. To ensure `ackermann x` is computed only once, you would need to memoize or cache the result of `ackermann x` and reuse it across recursive calls.

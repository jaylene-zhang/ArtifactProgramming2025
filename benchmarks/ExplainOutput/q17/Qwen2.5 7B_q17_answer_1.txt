No, the program computes `ackermann x` multiple times for a function call `add_ack x l`.

Explanation:
- The function `add_ack` always computes `ackermann x` at the beginning of each recursive call, even though the value of `ackermann x` does not change. This leads to multiple redundant computations of `ackermann x`, especially in large lists.

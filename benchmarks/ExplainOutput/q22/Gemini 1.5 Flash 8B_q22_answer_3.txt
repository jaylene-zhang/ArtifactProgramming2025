**Solution:**

`r` (declared within the `let r = 2 * y in` block) and `f` (declared within the `let f = ... in` block)

**Explanation:**

The inner `let r = ... in` rebinds the variable `r`.  The function `f` is also reassigned to a new function and no longer refers to the function parameter `f`.  These are not the original parameters, so they are unused in the final call to the reassigned `f`.

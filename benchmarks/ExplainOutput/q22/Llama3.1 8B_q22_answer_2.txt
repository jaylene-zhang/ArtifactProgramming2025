**Unused Variables**

```ocaml
("y", "f")

let call f r y =
  let r = 2 * y in
  let f = fun x -> f x * y in
  f r
```
Explanation:

- `y` is used in the binding of `let r = 2 * y` and also in the anonymous function definition `f`, so `y` is not unused.
- However, `f` declared in the outer scope is shadowed inside the `call` function with an anonymous function of the same name.

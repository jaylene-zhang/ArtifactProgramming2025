Unused variables:
- y (in the inner function definition)
- f (in the expression defining r)

```ocaml
let f = fun x -> (2 * y) * y
```
The inner function abstract over `y` which makes it immutable, however the outer `f` does not use it after the inner function is defined, so it is unnecessary to redefine `f` in the expression.

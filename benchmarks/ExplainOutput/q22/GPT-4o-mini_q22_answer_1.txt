The unused variable in the expression is `y`.

**Explanation:** In the `call` function, `y` is defined as an argument but is not used in any expression after its definition, aside from being used as an input to the function `f`. When `f` is defined, it captures the outer `f` as its variable, and while `y` is used within this definition, the original `y` provided as an argument does not contribute meaningfully to any computation that occurs. Thus, it is considered unused in the context of this function's logic.

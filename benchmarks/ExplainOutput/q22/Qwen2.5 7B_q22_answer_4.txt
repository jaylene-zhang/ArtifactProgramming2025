The unused variables in the expression are `r` in the second `let` binding.

Solution:
- `r` is unused because it is only assigned a new value and not used again.

Explanation:
- The first `let r = 2 * y` assigns `2 * y` to `r`.
- The second `let f = fun x -> f x * y` reassigns `f` to a new function, but the old value of `f` is not used after this binding.
- The value of `r` computed from `2 * y` is only used in the final expression `f r`, but since `f` is reassigned, the new `r` is effectively used with the new `f`.

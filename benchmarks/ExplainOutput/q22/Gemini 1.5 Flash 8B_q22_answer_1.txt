**Solution:**

`r`

**Explanation:**

The variable `r` is shadowed by the inner `let r = 2 * y` declaration.  The outer `r` is never used, since a new `r` is bound within the inner `let` block.  `f` is also shadowed, but that's confusing because it redefines the *function* it was referencing, not just a variable.

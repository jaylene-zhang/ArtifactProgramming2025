The unused variables in the expression are `r` and `y`.

```ocaml
let call f r y =
  let r = 2 * y in
  let f = fun x -> f x * y in
    f r
```

Explanation:
- `r` is assigned a new value `2 * y` within the scope of the `let r = 2 * y in` block and is not used elsewhere.
- `y` is not used after it is passed to the function `call`. Both `r` and `y`'s values are shadows and not utilized outside their respective bindings.

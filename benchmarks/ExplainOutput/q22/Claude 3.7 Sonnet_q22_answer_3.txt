Unused variables: `r` (parameter)

In the expression, the parameter `r` is unused because it's immediately shadowed by a local binding `let r = 2 * y` in the function body. The original parameter value is never used in any computation.

The parameters `f` and `y` are both used in the function body, and the locally defined variables `r` and `f` are also used.

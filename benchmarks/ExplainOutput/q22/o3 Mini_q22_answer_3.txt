Solution: The outer parameter r is unused.

Explanation: Although call takes parameters f, r, and y, the parameter r is immediately shadowed by a new binding (r = 2 * y), so the original r is never used. The parameter f is used in the definition of the new function, and y is used in computing r and in the function’s body.

The unused variable in the expression is `f` defined within the inner `let`. 

Explanation: 
In the function `call`, the variable `f` is redefined within the inner `let` as `fun x -> f x * y`. However, this inner `f` uses the outer `f`, hence the inner `f` shadows the outer one. The redefined `f` is not used anywhere in the code afterward, as the call to `f r` uses the outer `f`. Therefore, the inner `f` is considered unused. The variable `r` is also redefined, but it is used in `f r`, so it is not considered unused.

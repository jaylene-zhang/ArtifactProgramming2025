No, this won't work.

This statement is not suitable for induction because the second argument to rev_tl changes during the recursive calls. When proving by induction on l, you'd need to prove:

Base case: length (rev_tl [] []) = length []
Inductive step: length (rev_tl (x::xs) []) = length (x::xs)

But the recursive call in rev_tl doesn't maintain the empty list as the second parameter. Instead, a better property to prove would be:

length (rev_tl l acc) = length l + length acc

This more general property accommodates the changing accumulator and can be proven by induction on l.

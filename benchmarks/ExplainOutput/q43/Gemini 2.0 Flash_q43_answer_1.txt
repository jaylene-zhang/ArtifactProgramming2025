**Solution:**

No, this will not work.

**Explanation:**

The problem lies in the fact that `rev_tl` is not tail-recursive in its first argument. The auxiliary `acc` variable accumulates result, and the final result is in the `acc` variable when the first argument becomes empty. A correct goal would be:

`length (rev_tl l acc) = length l + length acc`

No, this would not work.

Explanation: The statement `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is incorrect for several reasons. First, the function `rev_tl` is not defined, which makes it challenging to assess its properties. If we assume `rev_tl` is intended to reverse a list while maintaining the same structure (which typically isn't the case in most definitions of reverse), the formulation would require more than just proving the length equality. Furthermore, when proving by induction on a list, we must examine both the base case (an empty list) and the inductive case (a non-empty list). For any meaningful induction, the definition and properties of `rev_tl` need to be clarified. Thus, this approach does not accurately establish the relationship between the length of the reversed list and the original list.

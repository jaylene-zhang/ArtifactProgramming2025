**Solution:** No, this inductive proof will not work because the statement is incomplete and does not account for the structure of `rev_tl`.

**Explanation:** The given statement, `length (rev_tl l []) = length l`, involves an accumulator function `rev_tl` (typically tail-recursive) to reverse a list. To prove this by induction, one needs to specify and reason about the behavior of the accumulator argument (the second parameter, `[]` in this case). This complicates the proof as the base case and inductive step involve reasoning about how the accumulator grows. A better approach would be to rewrite the statement to avoid the explicit use of the accumulator in the hypothesis, e.g., by proving a lemma about `rev_tl`'s structure or directly proving `length (rev l) = length l` using the standard `rev` recursive definition without exposing its implementation.

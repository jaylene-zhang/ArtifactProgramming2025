**Answer**: No, this would not work.

**Explanation**: The statement `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is incorrect because `rev_tl` is a function that typically operates on a list and an accumulator. It should represent reversing the list while retaining the elements, and it is generally defined to take two arguments: the list to reverse and an accumulator to collect the results. The empty list `[]` is not compatible as the second argument in terms of proving length preservation directly, as it doesn't consider how elements from the original list `l` are indeed processed. A more appropriate induction proof would involve defining the base case for the empty list and the inductive step for larger lists directly using `rev`.

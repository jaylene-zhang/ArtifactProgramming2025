**Solution:**

No, this would not work.

**Explanation:**

The base case (empty list) would be fine, but the inductive step would be difficult to prove. The `rev_tl` function is defined recursively as follows:

```ocaml
let rec rev_tl l acc =
  match l with
  | [] -> acc
  | hd :: tl -> rev_tl tl (hd :: acc)
```

The problem is that in the inductive step, you'd assume `length (rev_tl tl []) = length tl ` and try to prove `length (rev_tl (hd :: tl) []) = length (hd :: tl)`.  Expanding the left-hand side gives `length (rev_tl tl [hd])`. The inductive hypothesis doesn't give us any information about `rev_tl tl [hd]`, only `rev_tl tl []`. So, the induction hypothesis cannot be applied directly. The accumulator `acc` is the problem.  You need a stronger inductive hypothesis that relates `length (rev_tl l acc)` to `length l + length acc`.

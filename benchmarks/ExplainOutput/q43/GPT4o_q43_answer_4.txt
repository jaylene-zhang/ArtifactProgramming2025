**Solution:** Yes, this would work.

**Explanation:** The given reverse function `rev_tl` appears to use an accumulator to reverse the list. The proposition states that reversing a list with an empty accumulator (`rev_tl l []`) and then computing its length is equal to the length of the original list (`l`). 

Using induction on `l`, we can prove this:

1. **Base Case:** For the empty list (`l = []`), `rev_tl [] []` produces `[]`, and `length [] = 0 = length []`. The base case holds.

2. **Inductive Case:** Suppose it holds for a list `l` (inductive hypothesis):
   - `length (rev_tl l acc) = length l + length acc`
   Extend to `l' = x :: l`:
   - `rev_tl (x :: l) acc = rev_tl l (x :: acc)`
   - By the inductive hypothesis, the length of `rev_tl l (x :: acc)` remains equal to the sum of the lengths of `l` + `x` + `acc`.
   
Thus, the proposition holds for all lists, meaning the function preserves the length.

No, this would not work as a valid proof.

Explanation: The function `rev_tl l []` is not well-defined for proving properties about the `rev` function. It seems to attempt to apply `rev` on the tail of the list and an empty list, but without knowing how `rev_tl` is defined, it's unclear what property we're trying to prove. A better approach would be to directly define and inductively prove properties about the `rev` function itself, namely that `length (rev l) = length l`. Using an inappropriate or undefined function in the induction step would likely lead to incorrect conclusions.

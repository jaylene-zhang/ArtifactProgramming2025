**No**

The attempted proof does not align with the actual implementation of the `rev` function, which typically has two cases: `rev [] = []` and `rev (x :: xs) = rev xs @ [x]`. To prove that `rev` preserves the length of the list, you would need to prove `length (rev l) = length l`. The `rev_tl` function is not a standard function in the context of reversing a list, and the given equation is comparing it with an empty list `[]`, which doesn't seem to match the typical implementation of `rev`.

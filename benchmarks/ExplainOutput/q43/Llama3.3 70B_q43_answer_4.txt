**No**

This won't work because `rev_tl` is not defined for `l` and `[]` as its arguments in the base case. The base case for the induction on `l` is when `l` is `[]`, but `rev_tl` expects a non-empty list as its first argument. A correct approach would involve proving that `length (rev l) = length l` by induction on `l`, where `rev` is the function defined as `let rec rev = function [] -> [] | h :: t -> rev t @ [h]`.

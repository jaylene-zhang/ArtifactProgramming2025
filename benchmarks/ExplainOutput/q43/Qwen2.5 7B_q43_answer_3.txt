No, this approach would not work. Here's why:

**Solution:**
No

**Explanation:**
The attempt to prove `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` by induction is incorrect because the induction hypothesis is not properly aligned with the structure of the list. The correct statement to prove is:

`length (rev l) = length l`

This statement says that the length of the reversed list is the same as the length of the original list. The right induction hypothesis would be based on the structure of `l`:

1. **Base Case:** If `l` is an empty list `[]`, then `rev l = []`, and `length (rev l) = 0 = length l`.
2. **Induction Step:** Assume the statement holds for a list `l'` (i.e., `length (rev l') = length l'`), then prove it holds for `l' :: hd`, where `l' :: hd` is a non-empty list. This will show that reversing a cons cell and appending a head preserves the length.

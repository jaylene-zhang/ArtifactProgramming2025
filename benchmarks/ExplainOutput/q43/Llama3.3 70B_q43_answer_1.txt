**No**

This approach won't work because `rev_tl` is not the standard reverse function in OCaml, and even if it were, the equation would not hold when `l` is not empty, since `rev_tl` likely builds the reversed list by prepending elements to the accumulator list `[]`. A correct approach would involve using the standard `rev` function or defining `rev_tl` correctly, and using the property `length (rev l) = length l`.

**Solution:** No, this would not work.

**Explanation:** The proposed induction hypothesis is too weak. `rev_tl l acc` generally does not have the same length as `l`. The accumulator `acc` changes the length. A stronger induction hypothesis is needed, one that relates `length (rev_tl l acc)` to `length l + length acc`.

No.

**Explanation:**

The statement `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is incorrect for a reverse function. `rev_tl` likely takes two arguments, a list `l` and an accumulator that is initially an empty list. The function likely reverses `l` and places the result in the accumulator, although the way the accumulator is used is not clear enough. The attempt at induction makes no mention of the accumulator parameter.  The correct approach would involve induction on the length of the list `l`.

No, this approach would not work.

Explanation: The statement `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is incorrect and misleading. The function `rev_tl` is not standard in OCaml, but if it's assumed to reverse the tail of the list `l`, it is likely not preserving the entirety of `l` by using an empty list as the second argument. Furthermore, to prove properties like length preservation, one should typically use a proper induction hypothesis such as `length (rev l) = length l` instead, focusing on list `l` itself rather than specifying an empty list, which would not provide a valid base case or inductive step for the induction proof.

No, this will not work.

Explanation: The attempt to prove `length (rev l) = length l` by induction on `l` using `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is incorrect because:

1. The left side of the equation involves `rev l`, while the right side involves `rev_tl l []`.
2. `rev_tl l []` specifically takes a list `l` and reverses it, appending to an empty list `[]`, which is not a general reverse operation.
3. The induction hypothesis should directly relate to the structure of `l` in a way that can help prove the main statement for any list.

A correct approach would be to directly prove `length (rev l) = length l` using induction on `l`, considering its construction (head and tail).

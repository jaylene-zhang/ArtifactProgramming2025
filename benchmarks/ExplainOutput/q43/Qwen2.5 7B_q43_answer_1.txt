No, this approach would not work.

**Solution:**
```
length (rev l) = length l
```

**Explanation:**
The proof should show that the length of the reversed list `rev l` is equal to the length of the original list `l`. The current attempt proves something different (the length of `rev l` concatenated with an empty list `[]`), which does not directly relate to the length preservation of reversal. The correct induction hypothesis should be `length (rev l) = length l` and the base case should handle an empty list, while the inductive step should handle a non-empty list by considering the head and tail.

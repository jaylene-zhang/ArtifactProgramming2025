**Solution:**  
No, this would not work.  

**Explanation:**  
The equation involves `rev_tl l []`, which represents the tail-recursive version of the `reverse` function. This function includes an accumulator (`[]` in this case). Induction on `l` would not work directly because the accumulator affects the result of `rev_tl`. To correctly prove this, you need a more general induction hypothesis, such as:

`length (rev_tl l acc) = length l + length acc`

This generalization accounts for the accumulator and allows the proof to proceed by induction on the structure of `l`.

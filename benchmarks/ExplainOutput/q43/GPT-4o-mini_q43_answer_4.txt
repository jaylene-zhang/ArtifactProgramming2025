No, this would not work as a valid approach to prove that the reverse function preserves the length of the list.

**Explanation:** The expression `length (rev_tl l [])` is not well-defined in terms of OCaml list manipulation since `rev_tl` (which is not a standard OCaml function) seems intended to mean reversing with an accumulator but written in this manner does not directly relate to preserving lengths. Instead, one would typically need to consider how the reverse function operates on the entire list `l`. To prove that `length (rev l) = length l` by induction, one should instead define `rev` properly and then apply induction on the structure of the list, ensuring to account for both base case (empty list) and inductive case (non-empty lists).

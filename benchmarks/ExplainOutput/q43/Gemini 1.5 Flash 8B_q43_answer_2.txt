No.

**Explanation:**

The attempted proof is flawed because `rev_tl l []` likely refers to a function that reverses a tail of a list `l` with an empty list as an argument.  This is not a general statement about reversing the entire list.  Induction needs a base case and a recursive step that relate the length of the *whole* list to the length of the smaller list in the recursive step.  The given attempt does not adequately address this relationship.  It deals with an intermediate step, not the essential recursive structure needed to prove a property about the full reverse operation.

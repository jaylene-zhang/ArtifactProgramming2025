**No, this would not work.**

### Solution
```
let rec check_length lst =
  match lst with
  | [] -> 0
  | _::_tl -> 1 + (check_length tl)
```

### Explanation
The base case in this induction is `length (rev_tl [])`. However, the `rev_tl` function never returns an empty list, so we cannot prove anything using this base case. The goal is to prove that `length (rev_tl l) = length l`, not to prove that `length (rev_tl []) = length []`.

A correct approach would involve inducting on `l` instead of `rev_tl l`.

No, this would not work.

Explanation: The statement `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is incorrect and does not align with the expected behavior of the `reverse` function. What you want to prove instead is that for any list `l`, `length (rev l) = length l`. The `rev` function reverses the elements of the list, and you should show that its length remains the same as the original list after reversal. Induction on `l` would start with an empty list and handle the case of adding an element to the list.

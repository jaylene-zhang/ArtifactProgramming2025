No.

**Explanation:**

The provided equation attempts to use induction on the *tail* of the list `l` (presumably `rev_tl` is a function that reverses a list *tail*)  in the context of an empty list.  Induction needs to be on the *structure* of the list itself, not some part of it. A valid induction would need to consider the base case of an empty list and the inductive step involving a non-empty list consisting of a head and tail.  The proposed formula has a problematic context regarding what `rev_tl` does.

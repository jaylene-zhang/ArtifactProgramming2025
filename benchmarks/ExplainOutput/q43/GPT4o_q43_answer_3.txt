**Solution:**  
No, this proof would *not* work because the induction hypothesis wouldn't handle the additional accumulator argument `[]` in `rev_tl`.

**Explanation:**  
The function `rev_tl` is a tail-recursive reverse function with an accumulator. Its signature is typically along the lines of `rev_tl l acc`, where `l` is the input list and `acc` is the accumulator. The statement `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` introduces the base accumulator `[]`, which is not invariant across the inductive steps. In induction proofs, the property being proven should generally hold for all inputs, including arbitrary forms of the accumulator, not just the specific case of `[]`.

Instead, you would need to prove this generalized property:
```
length (rev_tl l acc) = length l + length acc
```
This is provable by induction on `l`. Once this is established, you can derive the specific case `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` by substituting `acc = []`.

No, this approach will not work.

Explanation:
The equation `length (rev_tl l []) = length l` is not correct and does not hold in general. The `rev_tl l []` part is not properly defined. If we want to prove that the reverse function preserves the length, we should instead consider `length (reverse l) = length l`. The `rev` function reverses a list, and we need to show that reversing a list does not change its length. This can be proven by induction on the list structure.

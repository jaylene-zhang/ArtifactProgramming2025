**Correct Options:** a, b

**Explanation:**

* **a) and b):** These options correctly define a recursive data structure.  `Location of url * bookmarks` (or `Location of string * bookmarks`) represents a bookmark containing a URL and potentially more bookmarks (nested within the `bookmarks` type). `Empty` represents the base case (an empty list of bookmarks).  This is the standard way to represent a list in OCaml (or more generally functional languages). Option 'b' uses the slightly more direct `string` instead of the defined `url` type, which is suitable too.


* **c):** Incorrect. `Location` is missing the URL part, making the structure incomplete and meaning that there would be no way to store the actual URL.


* **d):** Incorrect.  `Location of bookmarks * url` would imply that a single `bookmarks` can contain another `bookmarks`,  which isn't inherently a list data structure, and violates the typical requirement of collecting URLs. It's a tree-like structure.  The `bookmarks` is the container which holds another `bookmarks` structure *inside*.


In short, options a and b correctly model a list-like structure of URLs.

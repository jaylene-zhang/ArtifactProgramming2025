The valid options for defining the recursive data type `bookmarks` are:

a) type url = string
   type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty

b) type url = string
   type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

Explanation:

- Option a correctly defines a `bookmarks` type as either a `Location` containing a `url` and a recursive `bookmarks` or `Empty`. This allows us to chain multiple bookmarks.
  
- Option b is also valid because it defines `bookmarks` with an `Empty` variant and a `Location` variant containing a `string` representing the URL and a recursive `bookmarks`. However, it can be more explicitly defined as containing a `url` type rather than a `string`.

- Option c is invalid because it declares `Location` without any data associated with it, making it impossible to store URLs.

- Option d is invalid as well. This structure reverses the relationship, attempting to define `Location` with `bookmarks` first, which is not a standard way to model a list of bookmarks.

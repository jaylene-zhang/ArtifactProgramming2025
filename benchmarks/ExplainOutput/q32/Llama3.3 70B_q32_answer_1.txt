**Valid options are: a, b**

Explanation: Options a and b are valid definitions of a recursive data type to describe a list of URLs. Both define a `bookmarks` type with two constructors: `Empty` and `Location`. The `Location` constructor in both options takes two arguments: a URL and the rest of the bookmarks, allowing the list to be recursively defined.

- Option c is not valid because it does not account for the recursive nature of the bookmarks list.
- Option d is not valid because it incorrectly orders the arguments to the `Location` constructor, making the bookmark list the first argument and the URL the second. In a recursive list, the first argument is typically the element being added (in this case, the URL), not the rest of the list.

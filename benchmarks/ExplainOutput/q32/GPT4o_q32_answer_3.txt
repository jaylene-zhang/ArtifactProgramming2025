**Solution:**  
The valid definitions are:  
**a)** `type url = string`  
         `type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty`  
**b)** `type url = string`  
         `type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks`

---

**Explanation:**  
- **a)** is correct because it defines a recursive structure where each bookmark contains a `url` and a reference to the next `bookmarks`, with an `Empty` case for termination.  
- **b)** is also correct and essentially identical to **a)**, but the order of constructors (`Empty` first) does not matter.  
- **c)** is invalid because the `Location` constructor is defined without the necessary arguments to hold either `url` or recursive `bookmarks`.  
- **d)** is invalid because the recursive parameter appears out of order (`Location of bookmarks * url` would cause confusion in recursive traversal because the nesting of bookmarks comes before the URL).

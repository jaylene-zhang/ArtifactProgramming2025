a) and d) are correct solutions.

a) This defines a recursive data type for bookmarks where each bookmark contains a URL (represented as a string) and a reference to the rest of the bookmarks. The Empty constructor represents the end of the list.

b) This is incorrect because it uses string directly instead of the defined url type in the Location constructor.

d) This is also correct, just with a different order of fields in the Location constructor (bookmarks first, then url).

c) This is incorrect because the Location constructor doesn't contain any data about the URL or the rest of the bookmarks.

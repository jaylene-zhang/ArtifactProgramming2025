**Correct Options:**

b) type url = string  
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

**Explanation:**

- **Option b)** correctly defines a recursive list where `Empty` represents an empty list of bookmarks, and `Location of string * bookmarks` defines a bookmark as a tuple containing a URL (string) and a list of bookmarks (which can be empty or have more bookmarks).

- **Option a)** tries to define bookmarks as a pair of location and bookmarks, but it does not recursively build the list, and the location is incorrectly typed as `url * bookmarks` instead of `string * bookmarks`.

- **Option c)** does not define the recursive nature of the list as it only includes an `Empty` case and a non-recursive `Location` case.

- **Option d)** incorrectly nests the recursive part inside the `Location` constructor, which would not form a correct list structure.

Thus, the correct definition for the `bookmarks` data type is provided in **option b)**.

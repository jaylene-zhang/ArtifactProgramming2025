**Correct options:** a, b

**Explanation:**

* **a) and b):** These are valid recursive definitions for a list of URLs.  `Location of url * bookmarks` (or `Location of string * bookmarks`) creates a "cons" cell-like structure where each element (`Location`) contains a URL and a pointer to the rest of the list (the `bookmarks` part). `Empty` represents the empty list.

* **c):** Incorrect. `Location` is not paired with a URL or the rest of the list, so it's not a valid way to represent a list, lacking the data part a list needs.

* **d):** Incorrect. `Location of bookmarks * url` is incorrect.  The structure should be (`data`, `rest`).  This definition has it flipped, the rest of the list (`bookmarks`) should come first.


In summary, options a and b correctly define a recursive type that can represent a list of URLs, adhering to the structure and principles of linked lists in OCaml.

b, c

Explanation:
- Option b correctly defines a recursive data type for `bookmarks`. `Empty` represents the end of the list, and `Location` holds a `url` and points to the next `bookmarks` in the list.
- Option c also correctly defines a recursive data type. `Empty` represents the end, and `Location` holds a `url` and recursively references the rest of the bookmarks.
- Option a is incorrect because it defines `bookmarks` incorrectly; it should reference `url` rather than trying to create a pair.
- Option d is incorrect because it incorrectly places `url` in the second position of the tuple, potentially missing the `url` to reference from.

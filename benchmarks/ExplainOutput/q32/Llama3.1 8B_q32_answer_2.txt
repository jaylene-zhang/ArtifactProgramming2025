**Solution**

a) type url = string
type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty

b) type url = string
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

d) type url = string
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of bookmarks * url

**Explanation**

These three options are correct definitions for the recursive data type `bookmarks`.

* Option a) uses a discriminated union `Location` to distinguish between an empty list and a non-empty list containing a URL and a list of bookmarks.
* Option b) is similar to option a) but uses a different naming convention for the discriminant.
* Option d) is also correct, it uses a different naming convention for the discriminant and swaps the order of `bookmarks` and `url`.

Option c) is incorrect because it does not use a recursive data type to represent a list of URLs.

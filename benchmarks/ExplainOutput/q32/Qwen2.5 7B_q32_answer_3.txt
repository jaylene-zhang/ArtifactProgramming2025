**Correct Options:**

b) **type url = string**
   **type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks**

**Explanation:**

- Option b correctly describes a list of URLs where `Empty` represents an empty list and `Location of string * bookmarks` represents a location (URL) paired with the rest of the list of bookmarks.
- Option a incorrectly uses `*` between `Location` and `bookmarks`, implying a tuple, which is not what we want for a recursive list.
- Option c does not use the second argument to construct a non-empty list.
- Option d incorrectly places `bookmarks` after `url`, which disrupts the order and logic for a linked list structure.

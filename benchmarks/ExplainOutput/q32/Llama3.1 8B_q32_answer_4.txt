**Solution:**

a) Correct
b) Correct
c) Incorrect (missing bookmarks recursive part)
d) Incorrect (the types * and ** are not the same)

**Explanation:**

Option a is correct, but it's not the only definition. `Location` is a variant that holds a `url` and a list of `bookmarks`, and `Empty` is the base case that stops the recursion.

Option b is also correct, but it uses a different syntax. The placement of the `|` keyword allows this definition to work.

Option c is incorrect because a `Location` variant would need to hold a `url`. Option d would require using `**` for the recursive type, which is not the convention in OCaml.

The correct choices are a) and b).

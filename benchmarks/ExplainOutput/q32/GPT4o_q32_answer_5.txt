**Solution:**  
The valid definitions are:  
**a) type url = string  
type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty**  

**b) type url = string  
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks**

---

**Explanation:**  
For the `bookmarks` type:
- It should represent either an empty list (with a constructor like `Empty`) or a `Location` holding a URL (`url`/`string`) and the rest of the bookmarks (a recursive part).
- In option a), the definition correctly uses recursion: a `Location` has a URL and the remaining bookmarks.  
- Option b) also accomplishes the same representation using a slightly different order.

**Option c** and **option d** are invalid:
- c) lacks the recursive reference to `bookmarks`, so it cannot represent a list.  
- d) incorrectly swaps the order in `Location` and does not properly allow for binding urls recursively in a valid type.

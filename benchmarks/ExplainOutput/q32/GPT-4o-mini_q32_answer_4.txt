The correct options are:

a) type url = string  
type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty

b) type url = string  
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

d) type url = string  
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of bookmarks * url

**Explanation:**
- Option a) defines `bookmarks` as either a `Location` containing a `url` and another `bookmarks`, or `Empty`, which effectively builds a list structure.
- Option b) also creates a linked list structure for `bookmarks`, where `Location` holds a string (the `url`) and the rest of the `bookmarks`.
- Option c) is incorrect because it defines `Location` without any parameters, which does not adequately represent a bookmark.
- Option d) is valid as it creates a structure with `Location` referring to a `bookmarks` and a `url`, effectively constructing a linked representation.

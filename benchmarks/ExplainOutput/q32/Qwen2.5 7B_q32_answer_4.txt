**Solution:**
b, c

**Explanation:**
- **Option b (Correct):** `Empty` represents an empty list, and `Location of string * bookmarks` represents a node in the list containing a URL and a reference to another bookmarks node.
- **Option c (Correct):** `Empty` represents an empty list, and `Location of string` represents a node in the list containing only a URL, with a reference to the next node.
- **Option a (Incorrect):** While this defines a `url` type as a string, the recursive definition for `bookmarks` is incorrect. The tuple structure does not make sense in this context.
- **Option d (Incorrect):** The structure `Empty | Location of bookmarks * url` would imply that the recursive pointer is to another `bookmarks` containing a URL, which does not match the typical structure of a list of URLs.

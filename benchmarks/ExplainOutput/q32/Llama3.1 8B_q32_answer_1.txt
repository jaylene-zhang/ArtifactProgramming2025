**Solution**

a) and b)

**Explanation**

A) is correct because the bordel definition correctly types a `Location` node with a `url` field and a `bookmarks` field.

B) is also correct because a `Location` node will contain a `url` (of type `string`) and a `bookmarks` (of type `bookmarks`). In this case, `bookmarks` is actually a self-referential type (it appears on both sides of the `Location` constructor).

C) and D) are incorrect because option C does not provide a structure at all.

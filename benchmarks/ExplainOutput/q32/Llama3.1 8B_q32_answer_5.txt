**Solution**

a) type url = string
type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty

b) type url = string
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

d) type url = string
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of bookmarks * url

**Explanation**

A recursive data type defines a structure by itself in its own definition. In this case, we want to define a list of bookmarks.

- Option b is incorrect because it defines bookmarks as a pair, not a sequence, and the second element of the pair should be a list of bookmarks, not a string.
- Option c is incorrect because it does not specify any constructors for the recursion, so it is an incorrect recursive definition.
- Option a and d are correct because they define a list of bookmarks (cons cells) where the first element is a url (or key) and the second element is the rest of the list (or also a List).

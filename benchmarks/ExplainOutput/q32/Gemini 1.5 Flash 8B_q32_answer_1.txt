**Correct options:** a, b

**Explanation:**

* **Option a:**  Correct.  Defines `url` as a string and `bookmarks` as a list of URLs where each element is a `Location` containing a URL and the rest of the bookmarks.  This is a typical way to represent a list in OCaml, using pattern matching to access elements.

* **Option b:** Correct.  Similar to option a, but uses the slightly different placement of the string. It also works, representing a list of URLs.

* **Option c:** Incorrect.  The `Location` constructor is missing the `url` value, preventing it from holding actual URL data. This is a crucial error.

* **Option d:** Incorrect.  The `Location` constructor takes a `bookmarks` and a `url`. This is not a standard list representation, which would have a constructor that either holds the current item or the rest of the items. It represents a structure where you'd nest bookmark lists within bookmark lists, which is not what is intended to model a list of URLs.



In short, options a and b correctly represent a list of URLs using a recursive data type, akin to a linked list structure.  Options c and d do not represent a reasonable method of modeling a list of URL bookmarks.

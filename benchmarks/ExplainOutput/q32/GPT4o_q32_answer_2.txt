The possible definitions are:

**a) and b)**

### Explanation:

a) 
- The `bookmarks` type represents a linked list where each `Location` node contains a `url` (a string) and the rest of the list (another `bookmarks` value). 
- The list ends with an `Empty` value, making it a valid recursive type.

b) 
- Similar to (a), but the order of the `Location` parameters is swapped. It still represents a valid linked list structure.

c)
- Incorrect because `Location` has no fields. Therefore, it cannot store any URL or recursive reference, making it impractical to describe bookmarks.

d)
- Incorrect because it places `bookmarks` first in the `Location` constructor. This is not a typical way to model a recursive list, and it would cause confusion between the list structure and its contents.

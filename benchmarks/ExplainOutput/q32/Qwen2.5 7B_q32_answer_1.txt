Correct definitions: b, c

Explanation:

b) This definition is correct. It includes an empty list `Empty` and a structure `Location` that contains a `url` and a `bookmarks` list, which recursively points to the next item in the list.

c) This definition is also correct. It includes an empty list `Empty` and a structure `Location` that contains a `url`. To keep the structure consistent, a recursive pointer to `bookmarks` should follow, as it logically points to the next URL in the list.

d) This definition is incorrect. It suggests that `Location` contains a pair of `bookmarks` and `url` in reverse order, which does not align with building a list structure where `url` should come first.

a) This option is incorrect because it does not include a recursive structure to build the list of bookmarks. It only defines a standalone `url` type and a structure `Location` that does not reference itself.

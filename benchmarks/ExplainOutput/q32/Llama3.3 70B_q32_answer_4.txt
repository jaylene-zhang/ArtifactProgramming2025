## Possible Definitions

a) type url = string
type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty

b) type url = string
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

d) type url = string
type bookmarks = Empty | Location of bookmarks * url

## Explanation

The options a, b, and d represent recursive data types that can store a list of URLs.

- Option a: Each `Location` stores a `url` and a `bookmarks` (a list of URLs), so it's a nested list.
- Option b: Each `Location` stores a `string` (the URL) and a `bookmarks` (a list of URLs), also a nested list.
- Option d: Each `Location` stores a `bookmarks` (a list of URLs) and a `url`, which allows adding URLs to the end of the list.

Option c does not represent a list and cannot be recursive, as it only contains an `Empty` variant and a `Location` variant without any parameters.

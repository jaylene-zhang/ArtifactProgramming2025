**a) and b) and d)**

These options are valid recursive data type definitions for a list of bookmarks.

- Option a defines a recursive data type where a `Location` bookmark contains a `url` and another `bookmarks` value.
- Option b defines the same data type but uses a `string` directly instead of defining a `url` type alias.
- Option d defines the same data type as Option a, but the order of `bookmarks` and `url` in the `Location` variant is swapped.

Option c is not valid because it does not define a recursive data type; it only defines two variants, `Empty` and `Location`, without any fields.

**a, b, d)** 

These options define a recursive data type where each node in the list contains a URL and a pointer to the next node, effectively creating a linked list of bookmarks. 

- Option (a) uses an explicit `Location` constructor with `url * bookmarks` as its argument.
- Option (b) defines `Location` with `string * bookmarks` as its argument, which is equivalent since `type url = string`.
- Option (d) uses `bookmarks * url` as the argument to `Location`, which is also a valid definition for a recursive list.

Option (c) is incorrect because it does not define a recursive data structure. The `Location` variant does not contain any additional information.

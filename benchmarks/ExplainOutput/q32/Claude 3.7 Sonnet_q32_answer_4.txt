Solutions: a, b, d

Explanation: 
Option a) is correct as it defines a recursive data type for bookmarks with a constructor that takes a URL and another bookmark list, plus an Empty constructor.

Option b) is also correct - it's similar to a) but uses string directly instead of url type alias.

Option d) is correct because it's similar to a) but changes the order of fields in the Location constructor.

Option c) is incorrect because the Location constructor doesn't specify what arguments it takes, so it can't store a URL.

The correct options are a) and b).

a) type url = string
   type bookmarks = Location of url * bookmarks | Empty

This is correct because it defines a recursive data structure where each bookmark node contains a URL (of type url, which is a string) and a reference to the rest of the bookmarks. The Empty constructor allows for terminating the list.

b) type url = string
   type bookmarks = Empty | Location of string * bookmarks

This is also correct. It's essentially the same as option a), except that it directly uses string instead of the url type alias. The structure is still a valid linked list of bookmarks.

Options c) and d) are incorrect:
- Option c) is invalid because Location needs parameters to store the URL and the remainder of the list.
- Option d) has the wrong order of fields in the Location constructor (the recursive part should come second in a standard list-like structure).

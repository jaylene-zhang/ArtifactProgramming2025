**No**

The implementation does not correctly calculate the largest power of two that divides a number and is also not a tail-recursive function. 

The function `max_two_factor` passes `1` instead of `n` to the `helper` function. The result of `helper` is also not a correct calculation of the largest power of two, as it returns `2 * helper (n / 2)` instead of the number of times `n` can be divided by 2. A correct implementation would use a tail-recursive approach and return the number of times `n` can be divided by 2, not `2 *` the result. Additionally, the function does not decrease the problem size correctly in the recursive call.

Solution: The function does correctly compute the largest power of two dividing n (for n > 0), but it is not tail recursive because the multiplication (2 *) occurs after the recursive call.

Explanation: In the helper, after calling helper (n/2) the result is multiplied by 2. This means the recursive call isn’t in tail position. Also, note that max_two_factor calls helper with two arguments even though helper is defined with one parameter—this seems like a mistake in the code.

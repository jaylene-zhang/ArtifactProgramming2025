The implementation does not calculate the largest power of two that divides a number correctly and is not tail-recursive.

**Explanation:**  
1. The `helper` function starts with `n`, but in `max_two_factor`, it incorrectly initializes `n` to `1`. The recursion should start with the original integer `n` to count how many times it can be divided by 2. It should be `helper n` instead of `helper 1 n`.
2. The recursion in `helper` is not tail-recursive because it uses multiplication (`2 * ...`) after the recursive call. This means that the result of `helper` needs to be multiplied after returning from the recursive call, which prevents it from being tail-recursive.
3. To fix it, you can use an accumulator to keep track of the current power of two and thus make it tail-recursive:

```ocaml
let rec helper n acc =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then acc
  else helper (n / 2) (2 * acc)

let max_two_factor n = helper n 1
```

In this corrected version, the `helper` function is now tail-recursive and correctly calculates the largest power of two that divides `n`.

**No**
The given implementation does not correctly calculate the largest power of two that divides a number and is also not tail-recursive. 

Explanation:
- The function `helper` is called with `1 n` in the `max_two_factor` function, but it expects only one argument `n`. The correct call should be `helper n`.
- The implementation does not handle the case where `n` is `0` or an even number that is not a power of two. For example, if `n` is `10`, the function will return `1` instead of the correct result `2`.
- The recursive call `helper (n / 2)` is not in tail position because the result of the recursive call is multiplied by `2` after it returns.
- To fix these issues, the implementation should start the recursion with `n` instead of `1`, handle the base case where `n` is odd, and use an accumulator to store the power of `2`. 

Here is a corrected version:
```ocaml
let max_two_factor n =
  let rec helper n k =
    if n mod 2 = 1 then k
    else helper (n / 2) (2 * k)
  in
  helper n 1
```

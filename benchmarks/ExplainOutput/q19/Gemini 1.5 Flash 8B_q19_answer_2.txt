No.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let rec helper n k =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then k
  else helper (n / 2) (k * 2)
let max_two_factor n = helper n 1
```

**Explanation of why the original is incorrect:**

1. **Not Tail-Recursive:** The `helper` function in the provided code is not tail-recursive. Each recursive call does not immediately disappear.  The result is only calculated in the final step.

2. **Incorrect Logic (in addition to not being tail recursive):** The initial `helper` function does not track the power of 2.  The function `max_two_factor` doesn't have the correct argument for `helper` so it calculates a power of two from 1, which is incorrect.  It effectively just counts how many times `n` is divisible by 2, but the multiplication happens after exiting from the recursion so it is not correct.

 The corrected code calculates the power of two properly by tracking it in the accumulator `k`. The final `max_two_factor` function call now passes the initial value for the accumulator. This version is tail-recursive, efficient and correct.

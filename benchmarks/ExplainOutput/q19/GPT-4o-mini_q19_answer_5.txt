No, the provided implementation does not calculate the largest power of two that divides a number correctly and is not tail-recursive.

Explanation:
1. The `helper` function checks if `n` is odd (`n mod 2 = 1`). If so, it returns 1, which is incorrect because it should return 2^k. 
2. If `n` is even, it calls itself recursively with `n / 2`, but this results in a non-tail-recursive function as the multiplication (`2 * helper (n / 2)`) occurs after the recursive call. This creates a stack frame for each call rather than returning an accumulated result.
3. The `max_two_factor` function initializes the helper with `1` instead of `n`, which is incorrect.
4. A correct implementation should involve accumulating the power of two and should return it in a tail-recursive manner.

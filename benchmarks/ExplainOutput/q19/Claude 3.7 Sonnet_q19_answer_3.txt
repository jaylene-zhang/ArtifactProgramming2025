The provided implementation is incorrect. 

The code shown doesn't match the function call - `helper` is defined to take one argument but is called with two arguments. Also, the implementation doesn't calculate the largest power of two that divides a number.

A correct and tail-recursive implementation would be:

```ocaml
let max_two_factor n =
  let rec helper acc n =
    if n mod 2 = 1 then acc
    else helper (acc * 2) (n / 2)
  in
  helper 1 n
```

This uses an accumulator pattern for tail recursion, multiplying the accumulator by 2 each time n is evenly divisible by 2, and returning the accumulated result when we reach an odd number.

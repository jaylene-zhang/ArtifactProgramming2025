**No**, the implementation does not correctly calculate the largest power of two that divides a number.

The issue is that the `helper` function is not being called correctly in the `max_two_factor` function. It should be `helper n` instead of `helper 1 n`. Additionally, the base case when `n` is 1 should return 0 instead of 1 because 2^0 = 1 is the largest power of 2 that divides 1.

Also, the function is not tail-recursive because the `helper` function is making recursive calls and then multiplying the result by 2. To be tail-recursive, the last operation should be the recursive call.

Corrected code:

```ocaml
let rec helper n k =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then k
  else helper (n / 2) (k + 1)
let max_two_factor n = helper n 0
```

Explanation: In this corrected version, `helper` takes an additional argument `k` to keep track of the number of times we can divide `n` by 2. When `n` is no longer divisible by 2, `k` is returned.

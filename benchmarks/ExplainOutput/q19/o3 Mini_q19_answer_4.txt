Solution: The code does compute the correct largest power of two, but it is not tail recursive. Also, the call "helper 1 n" is incorrect since helper expects only one argument.

Explanation: The helper function multiplies 2 after the recursive call returns, which means it does not perform tail recursion. Additionally, the intended use of an accumulator (as hinted by "helper 1 n") is not implemented correctly since helper only takes one parameter.

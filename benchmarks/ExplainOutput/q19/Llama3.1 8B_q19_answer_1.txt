**No**

```ocaml
let rec helper n =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then 1
  else 2 * helper (n / 2)
```

**Explanation**

Although the function is tail recursive, it calculates the correct power of two that divides `n`, not the largest. The last operation of the recursive calls is a multiplication, not a function call.

The provided solution is incorrect and not tail-recursive.

First, the function signature `helper n` doesn't match its usage `helper 1 n`, suggesting a mistake in the code. The function as written would not compile.

If we assume the correct definition is:
```ocaml
let rec helper acc n =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then acc
  else helper (acc * 2) (n / 2)
let max_two_factor n = helper 1 n
```

Then:
1. This would be correct functionally - it tracks the accumulated power of 2 as it divides n repeatedly.
2. This would be tail-recursive because the recursive call is the final operation.

The original code fails on both counts:
- It's not tail-recursive since the multiplication by 2 happens after the recursive call returns
- The function signature doesn't match how it's being used in max_two_factor

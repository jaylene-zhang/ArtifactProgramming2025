Solution: The implementation is incorrect and not tail-recursive.

Explanation: 
1. The code has syntax errors - the helper function is defined with one parameter but called with two.
2. The function is not tail-recursive because the recursive call to `helper (n / 2)` is followed by multiplication with 2.
3. Logically, the algorithm tries to count how many times n can be divided by 2, but it's incorrectly implemented. The base case checks if n is odd (n mod 2 = 1), but this would return 1 even for odd inputs that should return 0.

**Incorrect Implementation**

```ocaml
let rec helper n =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then 1
  else 2 * helper (n / 2)
let max_two_factor n = helper 1 n
```

**Explanation**

The implementation is not tail-recursive because it calls itself on `n / 2`, which triggers another recursive call. The `2 *` is a non-tail call, because the recursive call is done before the result is combined with the rest of the expression.

Moreover, the implementation is not correct. It tries to count the number of times a number is even by recursively dividing it by 2 and multiplying the result by 2. However, this does not correctly count the number of trailing zeros of a number (which is equivalent to the highest power of 2 that divides the number).

A correct solution would be to simply count the number of trailing zeros in the binary representation of `n`, which is the highest power of 2 that divides `n`. This can be implemented using the following tail-recursive function:

```ocaml
let rec helper n acc =
  if n = 0 then acc
  else helper (n / 2) (acc + 1)
let max_two_factor n = helper ((Int.log (abs n)) / (Int.log 2)) 0
```

This implementation is both correct and tail-recursive. It uses the `acc` accumulator to keep track of the count, and the base case is when `n` becomes 0.

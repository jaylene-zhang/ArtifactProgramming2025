**No**

The implementation does not calculate the largest power of two that divides a number correctly.

Explanation: 
- The function `helper` takes one argument, but it's called with two arguments in `max_two_factor`.
- The function `helper` itself does not correctly count the number of times `n` can be divided by 2 before becoming odd.
- To be tail-recursive, the last expression in the function should be a recursive call to the function, but the `2 *` operation comes after the recursive call. 

Here is a corrected version:
```ocaml
let rec helper n k =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then k
  else helper (n / 2) (k + 1)
let max_two_factor n = helper n 0
```

### **Q4.1**

**Induction Hypothesis:**
For all hands `h` and all accumulators `acc`, 
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

---

**Base Case:**
Let `h = Empty`.

- `add_up Empty = 0`
- `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`

Thus, `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc = add_up_tr Empty acc`.

The base case holds.

---

**Step Case:**
Let `h = Hand(c, h')`. Assume the induction hypothesis holds for `h'`, i.e.,
`add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`.

We must prove that:
`add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc`.

Expanding both sides:

1. Left-hand side:
   `add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (1 + add_up h') + acc = 1 + (add_up h' + acc)`.

2. Right-hand side:
   `add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`.

By the induction hypothesis (`add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`), we know:
`add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`.

Thus, substituting this into the left-hand side:

`1 + (add_up h' + acc) = 1 + add_up_tr h' acc`.

By the definition of `add_up_tr` for `Hand(c, h')`:
`1 + add_up_tr h' acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc`.

Therefore, both sides are equal, and the step case holds.

**Q4.2**

Theorem 2: For all hands `h`, `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

**Proof:**
Set `acc = 0` in Theorem 1.

From Theorem 1, we know:
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

Substituting `acc = 0`, we have:
`add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`.

This simplifies to:
`add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

Thus, Theorem 2 is proven.

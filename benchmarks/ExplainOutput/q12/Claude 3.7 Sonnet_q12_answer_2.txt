## Q4.1

• Base Case:
    h = Empty

    add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc
    add_up_tr Empty acc = acc

    Therefore, add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc.

• Step Case:
    h = Hand(c, h')

    **Induction Hypothesis**: For all accumulators acc, add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc

    **Proof**:
    add_up Hand(c, h') + acc
    = (add_up h' + 1) + acc      (by definition of add_up)
    = add_up h' + (1 + acc)      (by associativity of addition)
    = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)     (by induction hypothesis)
    = add_up_tr Hand(c, h') acc  (by definition of add_up_tr)

    Therefore, add_up Hand(c, h') + acc = add_up_tr Hand(c, h') acc.

## Q4.2

**Proof**:
By Theorem 1, we know that for all hands h and accumulators acc:
add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc

Setting acc = 0, we get:
add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0

Since add_up h + 0 = add_up h, we have:
add_up h = add_up_tr h 0

Therefore, for all hands h, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.

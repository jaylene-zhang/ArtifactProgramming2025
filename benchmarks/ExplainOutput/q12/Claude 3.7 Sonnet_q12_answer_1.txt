Q4.1

**Base Case:**
h = Empty

To prove: add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc

Left side: add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc
Right side: add_up_tr Empty acc = acc

Therefore, add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc

**Step Case:**
h = Hand(c, h')

**Induction Hypothesis:** 
For hand h', add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc for all acc

**Proof:**
Left side: add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc = add_up h' + (1 + acc)
Right side: add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)

By the induction hypothesis, add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)
Therefore, add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc

Q4.2

**Theorem 2 (Main Result). For all hands h, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.**

**Proof:**
From Theorem 1, we proved that for all hands h and accumulators acc, add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc.

Setting acc = 0, we get:
add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0

Since add_up h + 0 = add_up h, we have:
add_up h = add_up_tr h 0

This completes our proof.

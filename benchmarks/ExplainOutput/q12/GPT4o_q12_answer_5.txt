### Q4.1: Theorem 1 Proof by Structural Induction

**Theorem 1**: For all hands `h` and accumulators `acc`, `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

We will prove this by structural induction on the hand `h`.

#### Induction Hypothesis:
For a general hand `h` and any accumulator `acc`, assume the claim:
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

#### Base Case:
`h = Empty`.

- **Left-hand side**: `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc`.
- **Right-hand side**: `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`.

Since both are equal (`acc`), the base case holds.

#### Step Case:
`h = Hand(c, h')`, where `h'` is the rest of the hand.

- **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc` holds for `h'`.
- **Left-hand side**: 
  ```
  add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (1 + add_up h') + acc
                             = 1 + (add_up h' + acc).
  ```
- **Right-hand side**:
  ```
  add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc).
  ```

By the induction hypothesis, `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`. Substitute this into the right-hand side:
```
add_up_tr h' (1 + acc) = 1 + add_up_tr h' acc.
```

Thus, `add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc`. The step case holds.

#### Conclusion:
By structural induction, Theorem 1 is true: `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

### Q4.2: Proof of Theorem 2

**Theorem 2**: For all hands `h`, `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

#### Proof:
Theorem 2 directly follows from Theorem 1. Let `acc = 0`, then from Theorem 1:
```
add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0,
```
which simplifies to:
```
add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.
```

Thus, Theorem 2 is proven.

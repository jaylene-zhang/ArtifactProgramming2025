### Q4.1

#### Base Case:
h = Empty

add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc

add_up_tr Empty acc = acc

So, add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc

#### Step Case:
h = Hand (c, h')

add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up h' + 1 + acc

add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)

By induction hypothesis, add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc. 

Therefore, add_up h' + 1 + acc = add_up_tr h' acc + 1 = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc) 

Hence, add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc

#### Induction Hypothesis:
For all hands h and accumulators acc, add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc.

#### Proof:
The proof is by structural induction on h. The base case is Empty, where we have shown add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc. The step case is Hand (c, h'), where we have shown add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc, using the induction hypothesis.

### Q4.2

Theorem 2 (Main Result). For all hands h, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.

#### Proof:
By Theorem 1, we have that for all hands h and accumulators acc, add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc. If we substitute acc = 0, we get add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0. Since add_up h + 0 = add_up h, we have add_up h = add_up_tr h 0, proving Theorem 2.

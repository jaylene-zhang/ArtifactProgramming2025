### Q4.1

**Solution:**

**Induction Hypothesis:**
For all accumulators `acc`, and hands `h`,  
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

**Proof by structural induction on h:**

1. **Base Case:**  
   When `h = Empty`:
   - Left-hand side: `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc`
   - Right-hand side: `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`
   - Therefore, `add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc`.

2. **Step Case:**  
   When `h = Hand(c, h')` (assume the hypothesis holds for `h'`):  
   - Left-hand side:  
     `add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc`
   - Right-hand side:  
     `add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`
   - By the induction hypothesis:  
     `add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`
   - Thus, the two sides are equal.

Therefore, by structural induction, Theorem 1 is proven.

### Q4.2

**Solution:**

To prove Theorem 2 (`add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`), use Theorem 1 above.

For `acc = 0` in Theorem 1:  
`add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`  
This simplifies to:  
`add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`

Thus, Theorem 2 is proven.

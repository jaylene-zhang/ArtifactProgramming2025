Solution for Q4.1:
--------------------------------
Base Case (h = Empty):
  add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc, and by definition, add_up_tr Empty acc = acc.
  Thus, the property holds.

Inductive Step (h = Hand (c, h')):
  Induction Hypothesis: For hand h' and all accumulators acc, add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc.
  We have:
   add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc
                 = add_up h' + (acc + 1)
  Also,
   add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (acc + 1)
  By the induction hypothesis (with accumulator acc + 1),
   add_up h' + (acc + 1) = add_up_tr h' (acc + 1),
  which completes the step.

Explanation:
We proved by structural induction on h that for any hand h and accumulator acc, add_up h + acc equals add_up_tr h acc.

Solution for Q4.2:
--------------------------------
By Theorem 1, setting acc = 0 gives:
  add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0
So, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.

Explanation:
The main result follows immediately from the general theorem by choosing the accumulator as 0.

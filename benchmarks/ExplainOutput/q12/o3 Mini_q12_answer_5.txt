Solution for Q4.1:
• Base Case (h = Empty):
  add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc  
  add_up_tr Empty acc = acc  
  Therefore, equality holds.
• Induction Step (h = Hand(c, h')):
  Induction Hypothesis: For any accumulator a, add_up h' + a = add_up_tr h' a.
  Then, 
    add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc  
                           = add_up h' + (1 + acc)  
                           = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc) by the IH  
                           = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc  
  Therefore, the equality holds.

Explanation for Q4.1:
We prove by structural induction on h. The base case is trivial. In the step case, using the induction hypothesis with accumulator (1 + acc) completes the proof.

Solution for Q4.2:
By applying Theorem 1 with acc = 0, we get:
  add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0  
  Hence, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.

Explanation for Q4.2:
The main result follows directly from the general statement (Theorem 1) by choosing the accumulator to be 0.

Q4.1

**Solution:**

• Base Case:  `h = Empty`
    `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc`
    `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`
    `0 + acc = acc`

• Step Case: `h = Hand(c, h')`
    `add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc`
    `add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (acc + 1)`

**Induction Hypothesis:**  `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`


**Proof:**

By the induction hypothesis, `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`.  Substituting this into the step case equation for `add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc`:
`(add_up h' + 1) + acc = (add_up_tr h' acc) + 1`
`= add_up_tr h' (acc + 1)`
This demonstrates the step case, completing the proof by induction.


Q4.2

**Solution:**

**Theorem 2 (Main Result).** For all hands `h`, `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

**Proof:**

By Theorem 1, with `acc = 0`, we have `add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`. This simplifies to `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`, which is the desired result.


**Explanation:**

Q4.1 establishes a relationship between `add_up` and `add_up_tr` that holds for *any* accumulator value (`acc`).  Q4.2 leverages this result by instantiating `acc` to 0 to specifically prove the relationship for the main result about the initial `add_up` calculation.  The core of the proof is a classic structural induction on the data structure representing hands of cards.

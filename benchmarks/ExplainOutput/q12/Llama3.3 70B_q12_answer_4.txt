### Q4.1: Proof of Theorem 1

**Solution:**

Base Case: `h = Empty`
- `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc`
- `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`
Therefore, `add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc`

Step Case: `h = Hand (c, h')`
- `add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc = add_up h' + (1 + acc)`
- `add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`
By induction hypothesis, `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`
Substituting, `add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`

**State your induction hypothesis:**
For all hands `h'` and accumulators `acc`, `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`.

**Explanation:**
The proof by structural induction on `h` involves two steps: the Base Case and the Step Case. The Base Case establishes the theorem for the base case of the recursion (`h = Empty`), and the Step Case assumes the theorem holds for some `h'` (the induction hypothesis) and proves it holds for `Hand (c, h')`.

### Q4.2: Proof of Theorem 2

**Solution:**
To prove `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0` for all hands `h`, use Theorem 1 with `acc = 0`.

- `add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`

**Explanation:**
Theorem 2 is a direct consequence of Theorem 1. Setting `acc = 0` in Theorem 1 yields Theorem 2, proving that `add_up` and `add_up_tr` with an initial accumulator of 0 are equivalent for all hands `h`.

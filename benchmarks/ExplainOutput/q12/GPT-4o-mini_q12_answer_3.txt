### Q4.1

**Induction Hypothesis:** For all hands `h` and accumulators `acc`, `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

**Base Case:** 
Let `h = Empty`. Then,
- `add_up Empty = 0`
- `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`

Thus, `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc`, which holds true since `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`.

**Step Case:** 
Assume the hypothesis is true for some `hand h1`. Now consider `h = Hand(c, h1)` for some card `c`:
- `add_up (Hand(c, h1)) = add_up h1 + 1` by the definition of `add_up`.
- `add_up_tr (Hand(c, h1)) acc = add_up_tr h1 (acc + 1)` by the definition of `add_up_tr`.

Now, by the induction hypothesis:
\[ add_up h1 + acc = add_up_tr h1 acc \]

Substituting this into our step case:
\[ add_up (Hand(c, h1)) = (add_up_tr h1 acc - acc) + 1 \]
\[ = add_up_tr h1 (acc + 1) \]

Thus:
\[ add_up (Hand(c, h1)) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h1)) acc \]

This completes the inductive step.

### Q4.2

**Theorem 2:** For all hands `h`, `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

**Proof:**
Using Theorem 1 where we substitute `acc = 0`:
- By the induction hypothesis from Q4.1, we have `add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`.

Thus, we conclude that:
\[ add_up h = add_up_tr h 0 \]

This completes the proof for Theorem 2.

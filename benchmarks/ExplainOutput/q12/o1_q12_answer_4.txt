Solution (Q4.1):

Induction Hypothesis (IH): For all hands h and integers acc, add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc.

Proof (structural induction on h):
• Base Case: h = Empty  
  add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc  
  add_up_tr Empty acc = acc  
  ⇒ holds.  

• Step Case: h = Hand(c, h')  
  add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc  
  By IH on h': add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)  
  But add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (acc + 1)  
  ⇒ holds.

Solution (Q4.2):

Theorem 2: For all hands h, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.  
Proof:  
From Theorem 1 with acc = 0, we get add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0, i.e., add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.

Explanation:

• We first prove a more general statement that includes an extra accumulator parameter (Theorem 1).  
• Using structural induction on the hand h, we show the base and step cases hold.  
• Specializing the accumulator to 0 yields the desired equality add_up h = add_up_tr h 0 (Theorem 2).

### Solution for Q4.1:

Theorem 1: For all hands `h` and accumulators `acc`,  
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

Proof: By structural induction on `h`.

#### Base Case:
`h = Empty`.  
`add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc`.  
`add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`.  
Thus, the base case holds: `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

#### Induction Hypothesis:
Assume that for a hand `h'`, the following holds:  
`add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`.

#### Step Case:
`h = Hand(c, h')` (where `c` is a card and `h'` is the rest of the hand).  
We need to prove:  
`add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc`.

- Left-hand side:  
`add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc`.

- Right-hand side:  
`add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`.

By the induction hypothesis:  
`add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`.

Thus, `add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc`.

By structural induction, the theorem holds.

### Solution for Q4.2:

Theorem 2: For all hands `h`,  
`add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

Proof: Let `acc = 0`. From Theorem 1,  
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

Substituting `acc = 0`:  
`add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`.  

Thus,  
`add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.  

Therefore, by applying Theorem 1, Theorem 2 has been proven.

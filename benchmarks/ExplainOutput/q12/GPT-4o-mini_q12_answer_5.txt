### Q4.1

**Induction Hypothesis:** For a hand `h` and an accumulator `acc`, we assume that `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

**Base Case:**  
Let \( h = Empty \).  
- \( add_up Empty = 0 \)  
- \( add_up_tr Empty acc = acc \)  
Thus, \( add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc \). This is equal to \( add_up_tr Empty acc \), satisfying the base case.

**Step Case:**  
Let \( h = Hand(c, h') \) where \( h' \) is an arbitrary hand.  
By our induction hypothesis, we assume: \( add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc \).

Now, we calculate \( add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc \):
- \( add_up (Hand(c, h')) = add_up h' + 1 \) (by the definition of `add_up`)
- Therefore, \( add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc = add_up h' + (1 + acc) \).

Next, we calculate \( add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc \):
- \( add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc) \) (by the definition of `add_up_tr`)
- By applying the induction hypothesis, we have \( add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc) \).

Combining both results:
- \( add_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc \).

Thus, by induction, the theorem holds.

### Q4.2

**Theorem 2:** For all hands \( h \), \( add_up h = add_up_tr h 0 \).

**Proof:**  
We can derive this from Theorem 1. Set \( acc = 0 \) in Theorem 1, which gives us:  
\[ add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0 \]
Thus, simplifying:
\[ add_up h = add_up_tr h 0 \]
Hence, the theorem is proven for all hands \( h \).

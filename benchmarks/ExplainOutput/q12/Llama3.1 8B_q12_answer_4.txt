I'll solve the problem step by step.

**Q4.1**

### Solution

Let IH (h') be: For all accumulators acc, add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc.

Proof:

* **Base Case:** 
	+ Let h = Empty. Then add_up h = 0 and add_up_tr h 0 = 0+0 = 0. 
* **Step Case:** 
	+ Assume IH (h'). We need to show that add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc for all accumulators acc.
	+ By the definition of add_up_tr, we have add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc = add_up_tr h' (acc+1) = add_up h' + (acc+1) by the induction hypothesis (IH).
	+ Also, we have add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up h' + 1 + acc = (add_up h' + acc) + 1 = add_up_tr h' (acc+1) by the induction hypothesis (IH).
	+ Therefore, add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc as required.

**Q4.2**

### Solution

Theorem 2 (Main Result). For all hands h, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0. 
Proof. Let IH (h') be: For all accumulators acc, add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc.
	+ Set acc = 0. Then add_up h' + 0 = add_up h for all hands h'. This is the desired result.

### Explanation

In the base case, we show that the statement is true when the hand is empty (h=Empty). In the step case, we assume that the statement is true for all hands (IH) and show that it is true for hands of the form Hand (c, h'). 

For the main result, we let acc = 0 in the statement of Theorem 1, where we have already proved that add_up_tr h' acc = add_up h'. Therefore, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0 as required.

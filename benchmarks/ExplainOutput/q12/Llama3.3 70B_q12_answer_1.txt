**Q4.1**

## Step 1: Base Case
The base case is when `h = Empty`. In this case, we have:
`add_up Empty = 0` and `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`.
We need to show that `add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc`, which simplifies to `0 + acc = acc`, and this is true for all `acc`.

## Step 2: Step Case
The step case is when `h = Hand (c, h)`. In this case, we have:
`add_up (Hand (c, h)) = add_up h + 1` and `add_up_tr (Hand (c, h)) acc = add_up_tr h (1 + acc)`.

We assume the induction hypothesis:
`add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

## Step 3: Proof
Using the induction hypothesis, we can rewrite `add_up (Hand (c, h)) + acc` as:
`add_up h + 1 + acc`.
By the induction hypothesis, this is equal to:
`add_up_tr h acc + 1`.
By definition of `add_up_tr`, this is equal to:
`add_up_tr h (1 + acc)`.
Therefore, we have shown that `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc` for all `h` and `acc`.

**State your induction hypothesis:**
For all hands `h` and accumulators `acc`, `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`.

**Q4.2**

## Step 1: Main Result
To prove Theorem 2, we can use Theorem 1 by setting `acc = 0`.

## Step 2: Proof
By Theorem 1, we have:
`add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`.
Simplifying, we get:
`add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.
This proves Theorem 2.

Therefore, we have shown that `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0` for all `h`.

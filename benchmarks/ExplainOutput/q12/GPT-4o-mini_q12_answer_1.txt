### Q4.1

**Induction Hypothesis:**
For a hand \( h \) and any accumulator \( acc \), we assume that for some hand \( h' \) (a sub-hand of \( h \)), the property holds:  
\( add\_up h' + acc = add\_up\_tr h' acc \).

**Proof:**

- **Base Case:** 
  Let \( h = Empty \).  
  Then:  
  \( add\_up Empty = 0 \)  
  \( add\_up\_tr Empty acc = acc \)  
  Thus:  
  \( 0 + acc = acc \), which holds true.  
  
- **Step Case:** 
  Let \( h = Hand(c, h') \).  
  By the definition of our functions:
  
  \( add\_up (Hand(c, h')) = add\_up h' + 1 \)  
  By our induction hypothesis:  
  \( add\_up h' + acc = add\_up\_tr h' acc \)  
  
  Thus, we have:
  \( add\_up (Hand(c, h')) + acc = (add\_up h' + 1) + acc \) 
  \( = add\_up h' + (1 + acc) \)  
  And for \( add\_up\_tr \):  
  \( add\_up\_tr (Hand(c, h')) acc = add\_up\_tr h' (1 + acc) \)  
  But from our hypothesis:  
  \( add\_up\_tr h' (1 + acc) = add\_up h' + (1 + acc) \).  
  Thus, both sides are equal:  
  \( add\_up h' + (1 + acc) = add\_up h' + (1 + acc) \), proving our step case.

### Conclusion:
By structural induction, we have shown that \( add\_up h + acc = add\_up\_tr h acc \) for all hands \( h \) and accumulators \( acc \).

### Q4.2

**Theorem 2 (Main Result):** For all hands \( h \), \( add\_up h = add\_up\_tr h 0 \).

**Proof:**
Using Theorem 1 with \( acc = 0 \):

From Theorem 1, we have:
\( add\_up h + 0 = add\_up\_tr h 0 \).  
Thus:
\( add\_up h = add\_up\_tr h 0 \).

This directly leads us to our main result since we have shown that adjusting the accumulator to 0 holds the property defined in Theorem 1 for all hands \( h \). Hence, the theorem is proven.

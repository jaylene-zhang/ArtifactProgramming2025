Okay, here are the completed proofs:

**Q4.1**

*   **Base Case:**

    *   h = `Empty`

    *   `add_up Empty + acc = 0 + acc = acc`

    *   `add_up_tr Empty acc = acc`

    *   Therefore, `add_up Empty + acc = add_up_tr Empty acc`

*   **Step Case:**

    *   h = `Hand (c, h')`

    *   Induction Hypothesis: `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc`

    *   Proof:

        `add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = (add_up h' + 1) + acc = add_up h' + (1 + acc)`

        By the induction hypothesis, `add_up h' + (1 + acc) = add_up_tr h' (1 + acc)`

        `add_up_tr h' (1 + acc) = add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc`

        Therefore, `add_up (Hand (c, h')) + acc = add_up_tr (Hand (c, h')) acc`

**Q4.2**

*   **Proof:**

    We want to prove `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

    From Theorem 1, we know `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc` for all hands `h` and accumulators `acc`.

    Let `acc = 0`.  Then, `add_up h + 0 = add_up_tr h 0`.

    Therefore, `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`.

**Explanation:**

*   **Q4.1: Inductive Proof of `add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc`**

    *   **Base Case:** Starts with the simplest hand `Empty`.  Proves that the equality holds when the hand is `Empty`.
    *   **Step Case**: Assume `add_up h' + acc = add_up_tr h' acc` holds for some hand `h'`. Create a new hand `Hand(c, h')` and prove that the equality also holds under this case. With both the base case and step case, we can prove our result.

*   **Q4.2: Proof of `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`**

    *   Relies on Theorem 1 which states `(add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc)`. By substituting acc with 0 and simplifying, we can easily show `add_up h = add_up_tr h 0`. This demonstrates how the more general statement proved in Theorem 1 is used to prove the original statement.

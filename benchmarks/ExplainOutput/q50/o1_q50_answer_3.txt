Solution:  
Only (a) is correct.

Explanation:  
(a) correctly preserves the right‐to‐left application of f by using (fun r -> cont (f x r)). This ensures that in the end, we get f x₁ (f x₂ (... f xₙ b ...)) just like fold_right. The others either reverse the order of arguments or introduce errors and thus do not match fold_right.

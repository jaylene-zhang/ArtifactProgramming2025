Correct implementations:  
**a) and c)**  

#### Solution:  
- **(a)** correctly implements the tail-recursive fold_right by using `fun r -> cont (f x r)`, which ensures the function is applied correctly in a right-to-left manner.  
- **(c)** also implements tail-recursive fold_right correctly via `fun r -> f x (cont r)`, which maintains the ordering and associativity of operations consistent with `fold_right`.  

#### Explanation:  
- The function `fold_right f [x1; x2; ...; xn] b` recursively applies `f` starting from the rightmost element of the list.  
- Tail-recursive implementations avoid stack overflows by using continuations (`cont`).  
- **(b)** and **(e)** misorder the arguments in `f` or misuse `cont`, breaking the `fold_right` semantics.  
- **(d)** fails because it applies `f r x` rather than `f x r`, reversing the fold order.

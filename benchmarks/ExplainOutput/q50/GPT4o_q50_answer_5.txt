**Solution:**  
Correct implementation(s) are:  
**a) and c)**  

---

**Explanation:**  
1. For `fold_right` implementation: The crucial aspect is maintaining the correct order of application of elements from the list. As `fold_right` processes the list from right to left, a proper continuation allows this evaluation order. 
2. **Option a:**  
   - The continuation is updated as `fun r -> cont (f x r)`.  
   - This correctly applies `f` to the current element `x` and the result of the recursive continuation, making it tail-recursive and correct.  

3. **Option b:**  
   - The continuation is updated as `fun r -> f (cont r) x`.  
   - This does not respect the expected order `(x, r)` of `f` arguments, making it incorrect.  

4. **Option c:**  
   - The continuation is updated as `fun r -> f x (cont r)`.  
   - This correctly applies `f` to `x` and the result of the continuation, preserving the expected order. Hence, it is correct.  

5. **Option d:**  
   - The continuation is `fun r -> cont (f r x)`.  
   - This reverses the argument sequence of `f`, making it incorrect for `fold_right`.  

6. **Option e:**  
   - The recursive call swaps the position of `xs` and `f`.  
   - This breaks the function signature, making it invalid.  

Thus, **a** and **c** are the valid, tail-recursive implementations of `fold_right`.

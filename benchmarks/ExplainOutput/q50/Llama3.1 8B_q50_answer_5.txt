**a) Incorrect**

The continuation is applied incorrectly: `cont (f x r)` should be `f x (cont r)`.

**b) Correct**

`cont b` is the base case. When the list is not empty, `aux_folder` calls itself with `f xs b` and a continuation that takes the result of `cont r` and applies `f x` to it.

**c) Correct**

Similar to (b), the continuation is applied correctly, swapping the order of `f x` and `cont r`.

**d) Incorrect**

`cont (f r x)` applies `f r x` immediately, losing the recursive structure of `fold_right`.

**e) Incorrect**

The function and list are swapped in the recursive call, which will cause a type error.

In general, a correct implementation of `fold_right` using tail recursion must apply the function `f` in the correct order, swapping its arguments to match the outer function's signature. This is achieved in (b) and (c).

**Correct Implementation(s):**

d)


**Explanation:**

The key to tail recursion in `fold_right` is to apply the function `f` to the accumulator `r` *before* recursing.  This allows the compiler to optimize the recursion away. Option d does exactly that:

```ocaml
aux_folder f xs b (fun r -> cont (f r x))
```

In this case, `f r x` is executed *before* passing the result to `cont`. This allows the accumulator to have a "building" effect with each recursive call, which is crucial for tail-recursion optimization.

The other options either apply `f` to the recursive call result _after_ the callback `cont` (meaning the recursive call does not immediately build the result directly into the ongoing computation), passing incorrect arguments to `f` or have the wrong order of operations to execute `f`'s accumulator updates in tail-recursion.

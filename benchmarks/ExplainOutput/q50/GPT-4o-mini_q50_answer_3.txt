The correct, tail-recursive implementation for the function `fold_right` is:

**a)**
**d)**

### Explanation:
1. **Tail Recursion**: For a function to be tail recursive, the recursive call must be the last operation performed in the function. This means that no further computations are done after the call returns.
  
2. **Implementation of `fold_right`**:
   - **a)** correctly applies the continuation after folding over the list. The function `f` is applied to `x` and the result of the recursive call, following the fold right logic, ensuring it is the last operation (tail call).
   - **d)** also maintains the correct order for the application of function `f` while maintaining tail recursion. It utilizes the continuation in a way that keeps the recursive call at the end of the function.
  
3. **Incorrect implementations**:
   - **b)** and **c)** do not maintain the order of operations correctly, as they apply `f` before calling the continuation, which breaks the tail recursion nature.
   - **e)** changes the order of applying `f` by reversing parameters, which leads to incorrect results compared to the expected behavior of `fold_right`.

Hence, only implementations **a)** and **d)** maintain both correctness and tail recursion.

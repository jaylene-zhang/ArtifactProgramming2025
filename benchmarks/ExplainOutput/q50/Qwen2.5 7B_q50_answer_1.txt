c

Explanation: The correct implementation is option c. It correctly passes the continuation to `f x (cont r)`, which means it first applies the function `f` to `x` and the result `r` (the accumulator), and then passes the result to the next continuation. This aligns with the behavior of `fold_right`.

Option a is incorrect because it is folding from left to right, which is the opposite of `fold_right`.

Option b is incorrect because it incorrectly applies the function after passing the result to the continuation.

Option d is incorrect because it incorrectly passes the result of `cont` to `f` instead of applying `f` to `x` and then the result of `cont r`.

Option e is incorrect because it is not tail-recursive; it incorrectly calls `aux_folder xs f b` and then applies the function, which changes the binding order and does not follow the `fold_right` pattern.

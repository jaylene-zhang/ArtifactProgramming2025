**c) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with**
 
Explanation: The correct implementation is `c)` because it applies the continuation `cont` to the result `r` after recursively applying `f` to `x` and the result of the recursive call `r`. This matches the expected behavior of `fold_right f l b`. The initial call should be `aux_folder f l b (fun x -> x)` to get the same result as `fold_right f l b`.

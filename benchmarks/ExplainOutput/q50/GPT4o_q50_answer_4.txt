**Solution:**  
The correct tail-recursive implementation is:  
**(c)**  

---

**Explanation:**  
To correctly implement a tail-recursive version of `fold_right`, the continuation must compose computations in the reverse order of the list. Here's why (c) is correct:  

- `fold_right f [x1; x2; ...; xn] b = f x1 (f x2 (... (f xn b)))`.  
- In the `aux_foldr` function, the continuation is passed to handle deferred computation, and the function `(fun r -> f x (cont r))` in option (c) composes the computation in the correct order.  
- All other options either handle the arguments incorrectly or place the composition in the wrong order.

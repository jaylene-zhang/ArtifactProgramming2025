### Correct Implementations:

a) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont b
    | x :: xs -> aux_folder f xs b (fun r -> cont (f x r))

### Explanation:

The correct implementation is **a)** because it correctly implements the fold_right function using a continuation. In a tail-recursive implementation of fold_right, you need to ensure that the recursive call is the last operation performed by the function, and the current operation is applied to the result of the recursive call. 

In implementation **a)**, the recursive call to `aux_folder f xs b` is the last operation, and the current operation `f x r` is applied to the result of the recursive call (which is `r`), so the function is indeed tail-recursive. 

Note that the continuation is initialized as `fun r -> r` to compute the same result as fold_right. The function `f` is applied in the correct order, from right to left, as required by fold_right.

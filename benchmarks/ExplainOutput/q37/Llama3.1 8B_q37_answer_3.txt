**Bug: Infinite Recursion**

Input: `-2`
Output: `Stack overflow error`

Explanation:

The function `triangle` calls itself with `n-1`, but does not handle the case when `n` is less than 1. When `n` is `-2`, the function will call itself indefinitely, causing a stack overflow error because the recursive call cannot reach a base case to terminate.

The issue arises from the fact that the function does not account for negative numbers, and when `n` is less than 1, the function should return an error or a special value to indicate an invalid input.

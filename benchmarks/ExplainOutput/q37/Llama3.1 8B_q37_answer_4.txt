**Bug in the implementation**

Input: 0
Output: 0

**Bug:** The function does not recursively calculate the sum of numbers up to n, it simply adds n to the result of the recursive call, which is incorrect.

The correct function should be:
```
let rec triangle n =
    if n = 0 then 0
    else n + triangle (n-1)
```
However, a more elegant and efficient solution would be:
```
let triangle n =
    let rec helper x n =
        if x > n then 0
        else x + (helper (x + 1) (n))
    in
    helper 1 n
```

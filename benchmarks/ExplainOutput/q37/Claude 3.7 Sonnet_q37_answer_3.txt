Input: 0, Output: 0

The bug in the implementation is that when n = 0, the function will continue to recursively call triangle(n-1), leading to undefined behavior (stack overflow) since the base case only handles n = 1. The function should have a base case for n = 0 returning 0, as the sum of 0 numbers is 0.

Let's test the function with (n, result):

(-1, 0)

The bug in the implementation is that the base case is checking if `n` is equal to 1, which is incorrect. The function should check if `n` is less than or equal to 0 (basically, when `n` is 0 or negative, the result should be 0), and handle the case where `n` is 1 correctly. The correct function should be:

```ocaml
let rec triangle n =
  if n <= 0 then 0
  else n + triangle (n-1)
```

However, to fix this, the function can simply be optimized by using a non-recursive function, like this:

```ocaml
let triangle n = (n * (n+1)) / 2
```

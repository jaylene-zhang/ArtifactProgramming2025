**Test case that will not pass: (10, 55)**

The input `n = 10` should produce the output `55`.

**Bug:**

The problem in the implementation is that the function calculates the sum of numbers up to `n`, but the recursive call `triangle (n-1)` starts from `n-1` and goes down to 1, whereas it should start from `n` and count down to 1.

The correct implementation should be:
```ocaml
let rec triangle n =
    if n = 1 then 1
    else n + triangle (n - 1)
```
The change is from `triangle (n-1)` to `triangle (n - 1)`, adding a minus sign. This will correctly decrement `n` in each recursive call.

However, this recursive function is still inefficient because it has overlapping subproblems and can be optimized using dynamic programming. A more efficient solution would be:
```ocaml
let triangle n =
    let rec loop i acc =
        if i = 0 then acc
        else loop (i - 1) (i + acc)
    in
    loop n 0
```

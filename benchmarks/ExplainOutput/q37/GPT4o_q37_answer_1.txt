(0, 0)

Explanation: The function does not correctly handle the base case when `n = 0`. By definition, the 0-th triangle number is 0, but the implementation only checks for `n = 1` as the base case. For `n = 0`, the function will recurse infinitely, causing a stack overflow. To fix this, the base case should include both `n = 0` and `n = 1`.

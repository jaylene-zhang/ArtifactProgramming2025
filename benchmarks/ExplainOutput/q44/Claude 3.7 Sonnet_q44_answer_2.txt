In the step case of an inductive proof about lists, we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list l, then it also holds for (h::l), where h is an arbitrary element.

This corresponds to showing that the property is preserved when we extend a list by adding a new element at the front. We assume the inductive hypothesis (that the property holds for l) and use this assumption to show the property holds for the longer list (h::l).

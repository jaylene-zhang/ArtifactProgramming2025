In the step case of an inductive proof about lists, we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `xs`, then it also holds for the list constructed by adding an element to the front of `xs` (i.e., `x::xs`).

The step case assumes the inductive hypothesis (that the property holds for `xs`) and then proves the property holds for `x::xs`, where `x` is an arbitrary element. This shows that if the property holds for a list of length n, it also holds for a list of length n+1.

In the step case of an inductive proof about lists, we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `l`, then it also holds for the list `x :: l`, where `x` is an element being prepended to the list `l`.

**Explanation:** This is known as the inductive hypothesis. The step case demonstrates that the property we are proving is preserved when an element is added to the front of a list. By establishing this connection, along with proving the base case (usually for the empty list), we can conclude that the property holds for all lists by induction.

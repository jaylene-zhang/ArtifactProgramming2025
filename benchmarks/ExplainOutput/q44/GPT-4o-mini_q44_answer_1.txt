In the step case of an inductive proof about lists, we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `l`, it also holds for the list obtained by adding an element (usually at the front) to `l`, denoted as `x :: l`. 

Explanation: This is known as the inductive hypothesis. We assume that the statement is true for a list of size `n` (the base case), and we need to show that it remains true when we consider a list of size `n + 1`, which is formed by adding a new element at the beginning. This forms a crucial part of mathematical induction, ensuring that if the statement is valid for small cases, it continues to hold for larger cases as well.

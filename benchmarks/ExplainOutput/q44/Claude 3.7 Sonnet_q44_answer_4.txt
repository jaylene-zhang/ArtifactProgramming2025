For the step case of an inductive proof about lists, we need to prove that if the property P holds for some list l, then it also holds for (x::l), where x is an arbitrary element.

This follows the structure of list induction: we first prove P holds for the base case (empty list []), then show that if P holds for a list l, it must also hold when we add an element to the front of that list.

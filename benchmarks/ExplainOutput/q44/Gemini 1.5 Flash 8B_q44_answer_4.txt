**Solution:**

The statement holds for the list constructed by adding an element to a list for which the statement already holds.


**Explanation:**

Inductive proofs on lists typically involve two cases:

1. **Base case:**  The statement must be proven for the empty list.
2. **Step case (Inductive Hypothesis):**  Assume the statement is true for some arbitrary list `L`.  You then need to prove that if the statement holds for `L`, it also holds for the list `x::L` (where `x` is an element). This is the critical step where you use the inductive hypothesis.

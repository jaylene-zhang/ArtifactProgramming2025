**Solution:**

We need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `l`, then it also holds for `x :: l`, where `x` is an arbitrary element.

**Explanation:**

In the inductive step, we assume the statement (the inductive hypothesis) is true for a smaller list `l`.  We then use this assumption to prove that the statement is also true for a larger list constructed by adding an element `x` to the front of `l` (i.e., `x :: l`). This establishes that if the statement holds for a base case (usually the empty list) and holds for `x :: l` assuming it holds for `l`, then it holds for all lists.

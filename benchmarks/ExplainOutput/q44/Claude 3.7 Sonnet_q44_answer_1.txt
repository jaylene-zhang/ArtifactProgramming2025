Solution: In the step case (also called inductive step), we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `t`, then it also holds for the list `h :: t` (where `h` is the head element).

Explanation: Inductive proofs for lists involve two cases:
1. Base case: Prove the statement for the empty list `[]`
2. Step case: Assume the statement holds for some list `t` (the inductive hypothesis), then prove it holds for `h :: t` where `h` is any element added to the front of `t`

**Solution:**

The statement holds for the inductive hypothesis on the tail of the list.


**Explanation:**

Inductive proofs on lists typically involve a base case (empty list) and a step case.  The step case leverages the assumption (the inductive hypothesis) that the statement is true for a list of length *n-1*.  You then need to show, using this hypothesis, that the statement also holds for a list of length *n*.

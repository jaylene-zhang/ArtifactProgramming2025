**Solution:**

You need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `l`, then it also holds for the list `x :: l` (where `x` is an element and `::` is the cons operator).

**Explanation:**

In inductive proofs over lists, the step case requires you to show that if the property holds for a list (the inductive hypothesis), it must also hold when you add an element to the front of that list. This extends the property from a smaller list to a larger one, building towards proving it for all possible lists.

**Solution:** In the step case, we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `l`, then it also holds for the list `x :: l` (a list with a new head `x` prepended to `l`).

**Explanation:** Induction on lists involves two parts: (1) proving the base case (usually for the empty list `[]`), and (2) proving the step case. In the step case, we assume the statement holds for a list `l` (inductive hypothesis) and use this to prove that it holds for `x :: l`, ensuring the property holds for all lists.

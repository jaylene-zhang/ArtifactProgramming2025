In the step case of an inductive proof about lists, we need to prove that if the statement holds for a list `l`, then it also holds for the list with an element added to the front (`x :: l`).

This follows the structure of structural induction on lists, where we first prove the base case (empty list) and then show that the property is preserved when extending a list by one element.

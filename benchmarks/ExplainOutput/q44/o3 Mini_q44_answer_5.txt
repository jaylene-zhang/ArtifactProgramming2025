Solution:
Assume the property holds for an arbitrary list l (inductive hypothesis) and prove that for any element x, the property holds for x :: l.

Explanation:
In the step case, you show that if the property is true for any list l, then adding an element to the front (forming x :: l) preserves the property. This completes the induction step.

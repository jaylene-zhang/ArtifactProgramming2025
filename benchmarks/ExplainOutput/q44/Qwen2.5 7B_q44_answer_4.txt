Solution: In the step case, we need to prove the statement for a list with an additional element.

Explanation: When proving a property about lists inductively, you typically use two cases: the base case (usually for an empty list []) and the step case (for a list with one more element). In the step case, you assume the property holds for a list `l` and then prove it for `l @ [x]`, where `x` is an additional element. This shows that if the property holds for a list, it also holds for a list with one more element, thus proving the property for all lists by induction.

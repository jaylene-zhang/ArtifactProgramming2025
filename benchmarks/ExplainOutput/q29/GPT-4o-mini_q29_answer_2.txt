a) Yes, the implementation is correct.
b) No, the implementation is incorrect.
c) No, the implementation is incorrect.

**Explanation:**
- **a)** Here, `curry (sumSeries f) 0` correctly sets the lower bound to 0, and `swap` rearranges the arguments to handle the upper bound and increment function properly, effectively making `sum_from_zero` valid.
  
- **b)** This implementation incorrectly applies `swap` after `curry`. It applies `sumSeries` without properly fixing the lower bound first, violating the structure expected. 

- **c)** This implementation incorrectly applies `swap`. It attempts to swap the arguments of the `sumSeries` function itself rather than currying it correctly with a fixed lower bound, which leads to incorrect argument order.

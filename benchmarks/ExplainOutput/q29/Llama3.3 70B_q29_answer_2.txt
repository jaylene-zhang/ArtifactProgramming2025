### Correct Implementation

b) is not correct due to incorrect usage of `curry`. 
a) No, because of the order of application in `swap`.
c) No.

The correct implementation is:
```ocaml
let sum_from_zero f =
  curry (sumSeries f) 0 (fun x -> x + 1)
```
or more explicitly:
```ocaml
let sum_from_zero f = fun b -> sumSeries f (0, b) (fun x -> x + 1)
```
### Explanation

We want to fix the lower bound to 0 and the increment function to `fun x -> x + 1`. The `sumSeries` function takes in a function `f`, a tuple of lower and upper bounds, and an increment function.

By using `curry`, we can partially apply the `sumSeries` function with `f`, the fixed lower bound `0`, and the fixed increment function. However, `sumSeries` expects the bounds to be a tuple, so we need to pass the upper bound `b` as part of this tuple.

The `swap` function is not necessary in this case because we are not swapping the order of any arguments. 

My initial solution, which is using `fun b -> sumSeries f (0, b) (fun x -> x + 1)`, directly achieves the desired behavior by fixing the lower bound to 0 and the increment function, and waiting for the upper bound `b` to be applied.

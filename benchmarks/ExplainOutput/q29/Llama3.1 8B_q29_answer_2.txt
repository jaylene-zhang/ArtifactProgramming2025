I'll go through each implementation and provide a concise answer followed by an explanation.

### a) let sum_from_zero f = swap (curry (sumSeries f) 0) (fun x -> x + 1)

**Answer:** `YES`
**Explanation:**

This implementation correctly applies the `curry` function to `sumSeries` with the lower bound `0`, then swaps the arguments to receive the increment function `(fun x -> x + 1)` as the first argument.

### b) let sum_from_zero f = swap (curry (sumSeries f 0)) (fun x -> x + 1)

**Answer:** `NO (Invalid syntax)`

The argument `0` is not properly formatted. The `curry` function expects a function as its argument, not a function call with an argument.

### c) let sum_from_zero f = curry (swap (sumSeries f) (fun x -> x + 1)) 0

**Answer:** `YES`
**Explanation:**

This implementation correctly applies the `swap` function to `sumSeries` with the increment function `(fun x -> x + 1)`, and then applies the `curry` function to receive the lower bound `0` as the first argument.

In both correct implementations (a and c), the `sumSeries` function is composed with the `curry` and `swap` functions to produce the desired function `sum_from_zero`.

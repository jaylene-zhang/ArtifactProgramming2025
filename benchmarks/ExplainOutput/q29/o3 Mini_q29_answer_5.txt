Solution: Only (a) is correct.

Explanation: 
(a) Correctly curries sumSeries f then fixes the lower bound to 0 and swaps the arguments so that (fun x -> x + 1) is applied as the increment.  
(b) Incorrectly applies 0 to sumSeries f (instead of to the tuple), causing a type error.  
(c) Incorrectly swaps the arguments so that the bounds get reversed (or misapplied), making it wrong.

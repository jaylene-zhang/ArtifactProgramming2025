**a)** Incorrect

**b)** Correct

**c)** Incorrect

**Explanation:**

**a) Incorrect:** `curry (sumSeries f) 0`  is trying to apply curry to sumSeries f, which expects two arguments, and then applying 0 to the result. This is incorrect.  The `curry` should be applied to `sumSeries f` as a whole.

**b) Correct:** `curry (sumSeries f 0)` correctly curries the function `sumSeries f`, with the first argument fixed to 0. Now you can apply another function and get the desired `sum_from_zero` output.

**c) Incorrect:** `swap (sumSeries f) (fun x -> x + 1)` is problematic.  The `swap` function expects a function taking two arguments. The `swap` should be applied to the whole `sumSeries` expression with `f` and `0` pre-supplied.  `sumSeries f` here expects two arguments (lower bound, upper bound) for the initial application but you only provide one.  The whole expression isn't correctly applied to the `swap` and `curry 0` function call order is not the expected form.



**Corrected Implementation (Illustrative, but not using swap/curry):**

```OCaml
let sum_from_zero f upper_bound =
  let rec aux i sum =
    if i > upper_bound then sum
    else aux (i + 1) (sum + f i)
  in
  aux 0 0
```

This illustrates the straightforward way to achieve the desired behavior in OCaml, without resorting to `swap` and `curry` for this particular case.

### Solution:
```
let foo w =
let w = 6 in
fun y -> w * y * w
```

### Explanation:

When we inline `w*2`, it becomes `6`. This changes the binding of `w` to be `6` directly. The expression `let w = x` is then redundant, as `x` is no longer defined. Therefore, it is removed. The final expression becomes the inner function with `w` bound to `6`. The variable `x` inside the inner function is simply a parameter. 

This final expression is equivalent to the original expression in terms of behavior. However, due to the inlining of `w*2`, the unnecessary computation of `x` is avoided.

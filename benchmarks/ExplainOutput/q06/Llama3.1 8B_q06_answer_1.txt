**Solution:**
```
let foo w =
  let x = w * 2 in
  fun y -> (x *) 2 + y * ((w * 2))
```

**Explanation:** After inlining `w * 2` with `x`, the new definition of `w` becomes irrelevant to the code that remains. Therefore, we simply substitute `w * 2` with `x` wherever it appears in the code. 

Also, keep in mind that we are replacing `x` with `w * 2` because that's what `x` was defined as in the original code - whereas in other code using `w * 2` has no connection to `x`

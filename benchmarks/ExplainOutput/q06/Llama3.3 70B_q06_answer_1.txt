**Resulting Program:**
```ocaml
let w = 3 in
let y = 2*(w*2) in
fun x -> w * y * x
```
**Explanation:**
The expression `w * 2` is inlined and replaces `x` in the given program. The `let x = w * 2` definition is inlined and `x` is replaced with `w * 2` in the `let y = 2 * x` expression. The resulting program is the inlined version of the original.

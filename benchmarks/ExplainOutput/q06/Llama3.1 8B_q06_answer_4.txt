## Step 1: Identify the inline substitution to be made
The expression "w * 2" needs to be inlined and substituted with its definition wherever it appears.

## Step 2: Identify all occurrences of w * 2
It appears twice in the second lambda-expression before EVALUATION (substituting x with w * 2 directly) below in its expression portion and in 2*x.

## Step 3: Replace all occurrences of "w * 2" with its definition
The occurrence in let x = w*w does not need replacement as per the initial formulation, instead we replace w with 2*(w*2).

## Step 4: Making substitutions 
In-place substitution:

let w = 3 in let y = 2 * (2*2) in fun x -> w * y * x

## Step 5: Simplify the expression by performing any redundant calculations
2*2 equals 4.
Replacing 2*2 with 4 wherever it's found results in:
let w = 3 in let y = 2 * 4 in fun x -> w * y * x

Immediate substitution of 4 results in:
let w = 3 in let y = 8 in fun x -> w * y * x

The final answer is: 
```.Scheme
let w = 3 in let y = 8 in fun x -> w*y*x
```
This is the resulting simplified program.

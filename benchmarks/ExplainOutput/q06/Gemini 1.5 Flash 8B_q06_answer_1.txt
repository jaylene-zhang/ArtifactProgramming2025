**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo w =
  let x = w * 2 in
  let w = x in
  fun y -> x + 2 + y * x
```

**Explanation:**

The expression `w * 2` is replaced with `x` wherever it appears in the body of the function and also other occurrences of `x` are there.  The `let w = x` assignment is simply a renaming and no changes happen there after inlining.

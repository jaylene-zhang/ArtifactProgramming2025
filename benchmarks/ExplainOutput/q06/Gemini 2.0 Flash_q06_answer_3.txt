**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo w =
let x = w * 2 in
let w = x in fun y -> w * 2 + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

The code inlines `x` in `fun y -> x + 2 + y * w` by substituting `x` with its definition `w * 2`. Note that the assignment `let w = x` is not inlined preemptively, but rather the value of x is directly substituted in the expression.

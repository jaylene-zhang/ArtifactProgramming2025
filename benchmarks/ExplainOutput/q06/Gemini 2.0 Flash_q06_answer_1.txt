**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo w =
let x = w * 2 in
let w = x in fun y -> w * 2 + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

The goal is to inline `w * 2` for `x` within the scope of `foo`, which is defined as:

```ocaml
let foo w =
let x = w * 2 in
let w = x in fun y -> x + 2 + y * w
```

We substitute `x` in `fun y -> x + 2 + y * w` with `w * 2`, resulting in the final program.

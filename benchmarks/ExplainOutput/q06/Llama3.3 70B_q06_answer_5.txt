### Solution

```ocaml
let foo w =
  let x = w * 2 in
  let w = x in fun y -> x + 2 + y * w

let w = 3 in 
let y = 2*(w * 2) in 
fun x -> w * y * x
```

### Explanation

In the first part of the code, the function `foo w` remains unchanged as the question only asks to inline `w*2` in the second part. 

In the second part, `x` is replaced with `w * 2`, so `let y = 2*x` becomes `let y = 2*(w * 2)`. This substitution is the result of inlining `w*2` and replacing all occurrences of `x`. The `fun x -> w * y * x` part remains unchanged as it doesn't contain any `x` that can be replaced by `w * 2`.

```ocaml
let foo w =
  let x = w * 2 in
  let w = x in fun y -> x + 2 + y * w

(* Inlining w * 2 and replacing all occurrences of x *)
let w = 3 in 
let y = 2 * (w * 2) in 
fun x -> w * y * x
```

Explanation: The inlined expression `w * 2` replaces `x` in the second program. Therefore, `2 * x` becomes `2 * (w * 2)`. Note that this substitution only applies to the occurrences of `x` in the second program, not in the first function `foo`.

**Solution:**

```ocaml
let foo w =
  let x = w * 2 in
  fun y -> (w * 2) + 2 + y * x
```

**Explanation:**

We replace `x` with `w * 2` wherever it appears inside the function.  Crucially, the `let w = x in` does *not* immediately substitute w; the expression w * 2 is substituted as x * 2 and `let w = x in` keeps the initial binding of x from outside. This means the `w` in the final expression remains as `w` rather than being replaced with `w * 2`.

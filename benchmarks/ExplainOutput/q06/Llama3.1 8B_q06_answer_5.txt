**Solution**

let foo w =
let x = w * 2 in
let o = 3 in
let y = 2 * x in
fun x -> o * y * x

**Explanation**

The expression `w * 2` is inlined and replaced with `3` when `w` is `3`. The resulting program has `2 * x` replaced with the original value `w * 2`, which is now `3 * 2`. This is equivalent to `6`.

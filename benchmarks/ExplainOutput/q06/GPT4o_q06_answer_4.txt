**Solution:**

The resulting program after inlining `w * 2` is:

```ocaml
let foo w =
  let w = w * 2 in
  fun y -> (w * 2) + 2 + y * w
```

**Explanation:**

1. The original program is:
   ```ocaml
   let foo w =
     let x = w * 2 in
     let w = x in fun y -> x + 2 + y * w
   ```

2. We see that `x` is defined as `w * 2`. According to the inlining optimization, we replace all instances of `x` with its definition, `w * 2`.

   Substituting `x` with `w * 2`, the program becomes:
   ```ocaml
   let foo w =
     let w = w * 2 in
     fun y -> (w * 2) + 2 + y * w
   ```

3. This completes the inlining process, resulting in the final program above.

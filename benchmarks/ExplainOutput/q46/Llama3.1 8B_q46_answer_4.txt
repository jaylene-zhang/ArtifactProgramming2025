Here are the solutions:

**1) For blank 1 we should write:**
`f a (hd s)`

**Explanation:** We start the output stream with the result of applying `f` to the initial value `a` and the first element of the input stream `hd s`.

**2) For blank 2 we should write:**
`fold f (f a (hd s)) (tl s)`

**Explanation:** We recursively apply the fold function to the remaining part of the input stream `tl s`, using the result of the previous iteration `(f a (hd s))` as the new initial value. This way, we build up the output stream incrementally.

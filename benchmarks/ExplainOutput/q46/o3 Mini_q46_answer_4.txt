Solution:
1) f s.hd a  
2) fold f (f s.hd a) s.tl  

Explanation:
The head of the folded stream is computed by applying f to the first element of s and the initial value a (i.e., f s.hd a). The tail is built recursively by updating the accumulator to (f s.hd a) and folding over the rest of the stream (s.tl).

1) For blank 1 we should write: `f s.hd a`

2) For blank 2 we should write: `fold f (f s.hd a) s.tl`

**Explanation:**

1. In `blank 1`, we compute the head of the output stream by applying the folding function `f` to the head of the input stream `s.hd` and the current accumulator `a`.

2. In `blank 2`, we recursively call `fold` with the tail of the stream `s.tl` and update the accumulator by applying `f` to the head of the stream and the current accumulator `f s.hd a`. This ensures we process the entire stream.

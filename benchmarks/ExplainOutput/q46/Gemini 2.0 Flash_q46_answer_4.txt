**Solution:**

1.  `f s.hd a`
2.  `lazy (fold f (f s.hd a) (Stream.tail s))`

**Explanation:**

1.  **`f s.hd a`**:  The head of the output stream is the result of applying the function `f` to the head of the *input* stream (`s.hd`) and the *initial* value `a` (or the accumulated value from the previous step). This directly implements the first element of the desired output: `f a1 a0`.

2.  **`lazy (fold f (f s.hd a) (Stream.tail s))`**: The tail of the output stream is recursively defined.  We use `lazy` to ensure that the rest of the stream is only computed when needed (streams are lazy).

    *   `Stream.tail s`: This gets us the rest of the *input* stream (a2, a3, ...).
    *   `f s.hd a`: This computes the next accumulated value.  It applies the function `f` to the head of the *current* input stream (`s.hd`), and the *previous accumulated* value (`a`). So `(f s.hd a)` becomes the `a` of the next input,
    *   `fold f (f s.hd a) (Stream.tail s)`: Recursively call `fold` with updated parameters to generate the output stream.

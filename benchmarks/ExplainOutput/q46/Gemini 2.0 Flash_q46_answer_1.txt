**Solution:**

1.  `f s.hd a`
2.  `fold f (f s.hd a) s.tl`

**Explanation:**

1.  The head of the output stream is the result of applying the function `f` to the head of the input stream `s.hd` and the initial value `a`.
2.  The tail of the output stream is obtained by recursively calling `fold` with the updated initial value, which is the result of the previous `f` application `(f s.hd a)`, and the tail of the input stream `s.tl`. This ensures the cumulative application of `f` as described in the problem statement.

1) For `blank 1` we should write: `f (hd s) a`

2) For `blank 2` we should write: `fun () -> fold f (f (hd s) a) (tl s)`

Explanation:
1) The `hd` field of the stream should be the result of applying the function `f` to the head of the current stream `s` (i.e., `hd s`) and the initial value `a`. This represents the first element of the output stream.

2) The `tl` field is a function that returns the stream formed by folding over the tail of the current stream `s` with the new state (which is the result of `f (hd s) a`). The lambda function `fun () -> ...` is necessary to delay the computation of the tail stream, allowing for lazy evaluation and handling of infinite streams.

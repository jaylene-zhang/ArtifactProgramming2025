1) `f (hd s) a`

2) `fold f (f (hd s) a) (tl s)`


**Explanation:**

1. **Blank 1:** The first element of the output stream `r` is obtained by applying the function `f` to the head of the input stream `s` (`hd s`) and the initial value `a`.

2. **Blank 2:** The tail of the output stream `r` is computed recursively by applying `fold` to the tail of the input stream `tl s` and the result of applying `f` to the head of the input stream and the previously computed result. This embodies the recursive nature of the stream's folding.  The `f (hd s) a` part is the current accumulator value, ready to be used for the next iteration.

Here are the solutions:

1. For blank 1 we should write: `f (hd s) a`

Explanation: This is because we want the first element of the output stream to be the result of applying the function `f` to the first element of the input stream `s` and the initial value `a`.

2. For blank 2 we should write: `fold f a (tl s)`

Explanation: This is because we want the rest of the output stream to be the result of folding `f` over the rest of the input stream, with the result of the previous fold as the new initial value.

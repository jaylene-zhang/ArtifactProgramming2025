1) `f (hd s) a`
2) `fold f (f (hd s) a) (tl s)`

Explanation:
- For blank 1, we apply the function `f` to the head of the stream `s` and the initial value `a`, because the first element of the output stream is the result of applying `f` to the first element of the input stream and the initial value.
- For blank 2, we recursively call `fold` with `f` applied to the head of `s` and `a` as the new initial value, and the tail of `s` as the new input stream, because the rest of the output stream is the result of folding `f` over the rest of the input stream with the new initial value.

1) For blank 1 we should write: `f s.hd a`  
2) For blank 2 we should write: `fold f (f s.hd a) s.tl`  

**Explanation:**

1) For `blank 1`, the head of the resulting stream should be the result of applying the function `f` to the head of the input stream (`s.hd`) and the initial value (`a`), which is `f s.hd a`.

2) For `blank 2`, the tail of the output stream is the result of recursively applying the fold function on the tail of the input stream (`s.tl`), using the updated accumulator value (`f s.hd a`). This ensures the folding process continues for the rest of the stream.

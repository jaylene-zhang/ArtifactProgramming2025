Solution:
1) f s.hd a  
2) fold f (f s.hd a) s.tl  

Explanation:
The head of the output stream is computed by applying f to the current stream head and the accumulator (a). The tail is then produced recursively by calling fold with the updated accumulator (f s.hd a) and the tail of the stream (s.tl).

1) `f a1 a0`

2) `fold f (f a2 a0) (tl s)`

**Explanation:**

1. **Blank 1:** The first element of the output stream `r` is the result of applying the function `f` to the first element (`a1`) of the input stream `s` and the initial value `a0`.

2. **Blank 2:**  To compute the rest of the output stream, we recursively fold the function `f` over the tail of the input stream (`tl s`), using the result of applying `f`  to the previous element in the input stream along with the accumulated result (`(f a2 a0)`) as the new initial value.

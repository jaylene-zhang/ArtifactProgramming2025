1) `f (hd s) a`

2) `fold f (f (hd s) a) (tl s)`


**Explanation:**

The `fold` function recursively processes the stream `s`.

1. **`f (hd s) a`**:  The first element of the output stream is computed by applying function `f` to the head of the input stream `s` and the current accumulator `a`. This is the base case.

2. **`fold f (f (hd s) a) (tl s)`**:  To generate the tail of the output stream, we recursively call `fold` with the updated accumulator.  The updated accumulator is the result of applying `f` to the head of the input stream and the previous accumulator.  We then pass the `tl` (tail) of the input stream to the next recursive call, effectively processing the rest of the stream. This ensures that the output stream's elements are correctly dependent on the previous elements.

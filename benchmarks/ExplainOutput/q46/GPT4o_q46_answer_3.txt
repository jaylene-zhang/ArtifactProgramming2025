1) For blank 1 we should write:
```ocaml
f s.hd a
```

2) For blank 2 we should write:
```ocaml
fold f (f s.hd a) s.tl
```

### Explanation:
1) **Blank 1** represents the `hd` (head) of the new output stream `r`. According to the specification, the head of the output stream at each step is obtained by applying the function `f` to the head of the input stream `s.hd` and the accumulated value `a`.

2) **Blank 2** represents the `tl` (tail) of the new output stream `r`. To generate this tail, we recursively call `fold` with the updated accumulator `f s.hd a` (incorporating the current head computation) and the tail of the input stream `s.tl`. This effectively processes the rest of the input stream while carrying forward the accumulated result.

This recursive structure respects the definition of folding over an infinite stream.

**Solution:**

1.  `f s.hd a`
2.  `lazy (fold f (f s.hd a) (Stream.next s))`

**Explanation:**

1.  **`f s.hd a`:** This calculates the first element of the output stream. It applies the function `f` to the head of the input stream (`s.hd`) and the initial value `a`.

2.  **`lazy (fold f (f s.hd a) (Stream.next s))`:** This creates the tail of the output stream.
    *   `Stream.next s` advances to the next element in the input stream `s`.
    *   `f s.hd a` calculates the accumulated value that will be the new initial value for the recursive call with the rest of the stream.
    *   `lazy` makes it such that tail of the stream is not computed until it is needed.

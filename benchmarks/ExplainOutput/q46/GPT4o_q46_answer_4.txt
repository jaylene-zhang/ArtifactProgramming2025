1) For blank 1 we should write: `f s.hd a`

2) For blank 2 we should write: `lazy (fold f (f s.hd a) (Lazy.force s.tl))`

**Explanation**: 
1. **Blank 1**: The head of the output stream (`r.hd`) is the result of applying the function `f` to the current head of the input stream (`s.hd`) and the accumulated value `a` so far.
2. **Blank 2**: The tail of the output stream (`r.tl`) is computed lazily by recursively applying `fold` to the tail of the stream (`s.tl`). The new accumulated value is updated to be the result of applying `f` to `s.hd` and `a`, which we pass along to the recursive call. `Lazy.force` ensures we safely evaluate the lazy tail of the input stream.

**1.** `f (get_hd s) a`
**2.** `fold f (f (get_hd s) a) (get_tl s)`

Explanation:
- Blank 1 should apply the function `f` to the head of the input stream `s` and the initial value `a`, which is the first operation described in the folding process.
- Blank 2 should recursively apply the `fold` function to the tail of the input stream `s` and the new accumulated value `f (get_hd s) a`, thus defining the folding process over the stream and accumulating values as it goes. This recursive call moves the folding process forward one step in the input stream, which is necessary for generating the rest of the output stream.

**Solution:** Yes, the function `zip_tr` is tail-recursive.

**Explanation:** In order for a function to be tail-recursive, the recursive call must be the final action of the function (i.e., nothing else is left to be executed after the recursive call). In `zip_tr`, every recursive call to `zip_tr` is performed as the very last operation in each branch. Specifically, the continuation `sc` ensures that aggregation work is deferred until the recursion finishes, keeping the function in tail-recursive form.

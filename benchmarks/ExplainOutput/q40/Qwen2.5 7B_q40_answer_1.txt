No, it is not tail-recursive.

Explanation: The recursive call `zip_tr fc (fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l)) t1 t2` is not in tail position because it is followed by the `->` operator and the function application `(h1, h2) :: l`. For a function to be tail-recursive, the last thing it does should be a recursive call with no additional operations following it. Here, the closure `(fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l))` is being passed as an argument, which means there is more computation to be done after the recursive call.

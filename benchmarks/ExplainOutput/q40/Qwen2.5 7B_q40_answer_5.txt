Solution: No.

Explanation: The function `zip_tr` is not tail-recursive. In the case where both lists `l1` and `l2` have elements, the recursive call `zip_tr fc (fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l)) t1 t2` is not the final operation of the current stack frame. Instead, it constructs a continuation function `(fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l))` and passes it to the recursive call. This means the continuation is built before the recursive call is made, which is not a tail-recursive structure. In tail-recursive functions, the recursive call must be the final operation in the function.

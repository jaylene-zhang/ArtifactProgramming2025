**Solution:** No.

**Explanation:** The function `zip_tr` is not tail-recursive because in the `h1::t1, h2::t2` case, after the recursive call `zip_tr fc (fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l)) t1 t2` returns, there's still work to be done, namely applying `(fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l))` to the result.  A tail-recursive function must have the recursive call be the very last operation performed.

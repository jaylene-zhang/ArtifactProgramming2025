No

**Explanation:**

The function calls `zip_tr` recursively.  The recursive call is not in tail position because the result of `zip_tr` is passed to `sc` (a continuation). The function `sc` awaits this result before performing its action; this prevents the compiler from optimising away the stack frame for `zip_tr`.  Therefore, it's not tail recursive.

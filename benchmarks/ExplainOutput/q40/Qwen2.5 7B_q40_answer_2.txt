No, it is not tail-recursive.

Explanation: The function `zip_tr` is not tail-recursive because the recursive call to `zip_tr` in the `h1::t1, h2::t2` branch is not the last operation in that branch. The function constructs a new closure `(fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l))` to pass as an argument to the recursive call, but this closure is evaluated after the recursive call returns. This means the recursive call is not in tail position. For a function to be tail-recursive, all recursive calls must be the last operation in the function.

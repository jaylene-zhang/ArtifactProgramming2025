Yes, it is tail-recursive.

The function `zip_tr` is tail-recursive because all recursive calls to `zip_tr` are in tail position. Specifically, in the pattern matching case for `h1::t1, h2::t2`, the recursive call to `zip_tr` is the last operation performed before returning. This allows the compiler to optimize the recursion into a loop, avoiding stack overflow for large inputs.

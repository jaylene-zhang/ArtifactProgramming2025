**No**

This function is not tail-recursive because the recursive call is not the last operation performed in the `h1::t1, h2::t2` branch. Instead, the result of the recursive call is passed to the `sc` function, which is then applied to the result of `zip_tr fc (fun l -> sc ((h1, h2) :: l)) t1 t2`.

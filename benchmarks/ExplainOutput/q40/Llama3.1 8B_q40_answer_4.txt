### Solution

```ocaml
let rec zip_tr fc sc l1 l2 =
  let rec loop l1 l2 acc =
    match l1, l2 with
    | [], [] -> sc (List.rev acc)
    | [], _ -> fc (List.length l2) (List.rev acc)
    | _, [] -> fc (List.length l1) (List.rev acc)
    | h1::t1, h2::t2 ->
      loop t1 t2 ((h1, h2) :: acc)
  in
  loop l1 l2 []
```

### Explanation

The original function is not tail-recursive because the recursive call is not the last operation, it is still combined with `::` to create the accumulator list.

In the modified version, we've introduced an inner recursive function `loop` that takes the original lists and the accumulator as arguments. This allows the recursive call to be the last operation, making the function tail-recursive. We also need to reverse the accumulator at the end to maintain the original order of the elements.

**No, it is not tail-recursive.**

Solution:
```ocaml
let rec zip_tr fc sc l1 l2 =
  match l1 with
  | [] -> sc l2
  | h1 :: t1 ->
    let l2' = List.rev_append t2 l2 in
    fc (fun l ->
      sc ((h1, hd l2') :: (zip_tr fc sc t1 (tl l2'))
       )
    )
```

Explanation: In the original code, the recursive call to `zip_tr` is not the last expression evaluated. The `fc` continuation is applied after the recursive call, making it not tail-recursive. In the revised version, I used `rev_append` and pattern matching to transform the function into tail-recursive pattern.

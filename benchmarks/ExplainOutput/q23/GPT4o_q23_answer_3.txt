The type of `shift` is:

```ocaml
val shift : (int ref * int ref) -> unit
```

### Explanation:
- The function `shift` takes a pair of `int ref`s (mutable integer references). This is evident from how it performs operations like `!` (de-referencing) and `:=` (assignment) on the `x` and `y` components of the pair.
- It does not return any value (its return type is `unit`) because all it does is mutate the values pointed to by the references inside the pair. There is no explicit return.

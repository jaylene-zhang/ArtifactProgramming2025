**Solution:**  
`shift : (int ref * int ref) -> unit`

**Explanation:**  
The function `shift` takes a pair `(int ref * int ref)` as an argument, where each part of the pair is a reference to an integer. It modifies the values of the integer references directly using the `:=` operator, resulting in a side effect. Since there is no returned value, its return type is `unit`.

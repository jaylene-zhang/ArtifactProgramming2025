**Solution**
```
val shift : unit -> unit
```

**Explanation**

The function `shift` does not return anything (i.e., it has no value), and takes no arguments. However, it does modify mutable references `x` and `y` that are borrowed from the input `point`. The type `unit -> unit` indicates that the function consumes one unit (`()`) and produces no output.

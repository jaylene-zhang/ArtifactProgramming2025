**Solution:**

`val shift : (int ref * int ref) -> unit`

**Explanation:**

The function `shift` takes a tuple where each element is a reference to an integer (`int ref * int ref`). It modifies the values pointed to by these references, but it doesn't return any meaningful value. Therefore, its return type is `unit`.

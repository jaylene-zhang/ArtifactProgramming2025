**Solution**:  
The type of `shift` is `(int ref * int ref) -> unit`.

---

**Explanation**:  
- The function `shift` takes a single parameter `point`, which is a tuple `(x, y)`. Both `x` and `y` are `int ref` (references to integers). This is clear from the type of `point` defined as `(ref 4, ref 3)`, which has the type `(int ref * int ref)`.
- Inside `shift`, the components `x` and `y` are accessed using `component_x` and `component_y`, and their referenced values are modified using `:=`.
- Since `shift` only modifies the contents of the references and does not return a value, its return type is `unit`.  
Hence, the type of `shift` is `(int ref * int ref) -> unit`.

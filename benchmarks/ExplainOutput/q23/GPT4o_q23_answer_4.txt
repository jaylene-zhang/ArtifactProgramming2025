The type of `shift` is:

```ocaml
shift : (int ref * int ref) -> unit
```

### Explanation:
1. `shift` takes a parameter `point` which is a tuple `(x, y)`. Both `x` and `y` are references of type `int ref`.
2. The function modifies the referred values of `x` and `y` by incrementing them using the `:=` operator, which has the `unit` return type.
3. Hence, the input type is `(int ref * int ref)`, and the return type is `unit`.

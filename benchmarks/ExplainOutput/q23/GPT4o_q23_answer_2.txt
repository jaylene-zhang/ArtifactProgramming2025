Solution:  
The type of `shift` is  
```ocaml
'ref * 'ref -> unit
```

Explanation:  
- The `shift` function takes a tuple (`point`), where both components are references (`ref`).
- It modifies the contents of these references by dereferencing them and incrementing their values.
- The function is purely for side effects (modifying the references) and returns `unit`.

**Solution**
```ocaml
let rec factorial n =
  if n = 0 then 1 else n * factorial (n - 1)
```
**Explanation**

The reason functions in the standard List library of OCaml are not all tail-recursive is because of the trade-off between performance and abstraction. Tail recursion can be less efficient than non-tail recursion in OCaml because it requires additional stack operations.

While continuations can give us tail-recursiveness, they also come with additional overhead, making the code harder to reason about and potentially slower.

For example, the above `factorial` function is not tail-recursive, but it's still efficient because it uses pattern matching and a simple recursion. The standard List library's functions are designed to be efficient and easy to use, rather than solely focused on tail recursiveness.

In general, OCaml's standard library balances performance and abstraction, using non-tail recursion when it's more readable and efficient.

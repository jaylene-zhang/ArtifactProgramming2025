**Reason:** Not all functions in the standard List library of OCaml are tail-recursive because they prioritize clarity and simplicity over tail-recursiveness.

**Explanation:** While it's true that using continuations can transform non-tail-recursive functions into tail-recursive ones, this often comes at the cost of added complexity and reduced readability. The standard List library favors straightforward implementations that are easy to understand and use, even if they may cause stack overflows for very large inputs. Tail-recursive versions of these functions can be implemented manually when needed, but are not provided by default for the sake of simplicity.

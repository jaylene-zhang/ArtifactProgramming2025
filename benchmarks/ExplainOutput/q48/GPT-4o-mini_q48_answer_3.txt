Functions in the standard List library of OCaml are not all tail-recursive primarily due to design choices that prioritize clarity and expressiveness over performance. While many operations on lists can be implemented in a tail-recursive manner, others naturally incur additional overhead or complexity when forced into a tail-recursive style.

Using continuations can achieve tail-recursiveness, but it can complicate the code and make it harder to read and maintain. Therefore, for common operations, such as `List.map` and `List.fold_left`, the standard library opts for straightforward implementations that may not be tail-recursive but are easier for users to understand and use effectively. Tail recursion is important for performance, but it is often balanced against other design considerations in library APIs.

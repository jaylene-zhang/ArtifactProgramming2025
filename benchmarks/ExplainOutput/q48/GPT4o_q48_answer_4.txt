Solution: Functions in the standard `List` library of OCaml are not all tail-recursive because making them tail-recursive often requires additional allocations (e.g., creating continuations or reversing lists), which can introduce significant overhead for relatively small inputs. The standard library prioritizes simplicity and efficiency for typical use cases over tail-recursiveness for all functions.

Explanation: Tail-recursive functions avoid stack overflows by ensuring no additional work is required after a recursive call. However, for functions like `List.map` or `List.fold_right`, making them tail-recursive would require constructing intermediate data structures or using techniques that might degrade performance for small lists, which are common in practice. The design choice balances performance and stack safety, with tail-recursive alternatives left to other libraries or user-defined functions.

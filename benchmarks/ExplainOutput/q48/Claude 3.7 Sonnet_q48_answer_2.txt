The standard List library functions in OCaml aren't all tail-recursive primarily for readability and efficiency trade-offs.

While continuations can indeed make any function tail-recursive, this transformation:

1. Makes code significantly more complex and harder to read
2. Introduces overhead from the continuation passing style (CPS)
3. Is unnecessary for many cases where the list size is reasonably bounded

For example, `List.map` in its non-tail-recursive form is very intuitive:
```ocaml
let rec map f = function
  | [] -> []
  | x::xs -> f x :: map f xs
```

Its tail-recursive version with continuations would be less readable:
```ocaml
let map f l =
  let rec map_aux f l cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont []
    | x::xs -> map_aux f xs (fun r -> cont (f x :: r))
  in
  map_aux f l (fun x -> x)
```

OCaml's standard library balances performance, readability, and stack safety as appropriate for each function's typical use case.

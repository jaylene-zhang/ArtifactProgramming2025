Solution: While continuations can make a function tail-recursive, they typically add complexity and potentially overhead that may not be desirable for all functions.

Explanation: Though continuations enable tail recursion, the List library designers chose not to make all functions tail-recursive because:
1. Continuations add conceptual complexity making code harder to read/maintain
2. Continuation-passing style can introduce runtime overhead for simpler operations
3. For smaller lists, the stack overflow risk of non-tail-recursive functions is minimal
4. Performance characteristics may be worse for some operations when forcing tail recursion
5. The library aims to balance readability, performance, and safety

The standard library provides tail-recursive alternatives (like List.rev_map) when stack overflow is a concern for large inputs.

Functions in the standard List library of OCaml are not all tail-recursive primarily for reasons of clarity, ease of understanding, and practical performance under typical use cases. While using continuations can transform certain functions into tail-recursive versions, this often involves added complexity, making the code less readable. Moreover, many list-processing functions (e.g., `map`, `filter`) are used in contexts where stack growth is manageable, and the benefits of tail-call optimization are not significant enough to warrant the added complexity of using continuations just for tail-recursion. Thus, the standard library prioritizes straightforward implementations that balance performance with maintainability.

1) ones
2) pascal_psums (ones)

**Explanation:**

1. The first diagonal in Pascal's triangle is a stream of ones, which is represented by the `ones` variable.

2. To generate the next diagonal, we use partial sums of the current diagonal, which is done by applying the `pascal_psums` function to the current diagonal (`ones`). The `pascal_psums` function maps the partial sums to each element in the current diagonal. This process is repeated recursively to generate all diagonals in the Pascal triangle. 

Here `pascal_psums` is a function that applies the `psums` operation to a given stream, and this operation returns a new stream that corresponds to the partial sums of the original stream.

Assuming `psums` is defined as:

```ocaml
let rec psums s =
  let rec aux acc = function
  | Empty -> Empty
  | Cons (x, tl) -> Cons (acc + x, aux (acc + x) tl)
  in
  aux 0 s
```

And `pascal_psums` is:

```ocaml
let pascal_psums s =
  map (fun x -> x) (psums s)
```

However, in real implementation `pascal_psums` might simply be `psums` if `psums` already works with streams. 

In this case, `pascal_psums` would simply be replaced with `psums`. 

So, for blank 2, it would be:
```ocaml
psums ones
```

Then `pascal` function will look like:
```ocaml
let rec pascal =
    { hd = ones;
      tl = Susp (fun () -> psums (pascal.hd))
    }
```

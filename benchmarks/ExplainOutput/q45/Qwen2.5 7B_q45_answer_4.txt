1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write: `ones`

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write: `pascal`

**Explanation:**

- For **blank 1**: The first diagonal (i = 0) of Pascal's Triangle is a stream of 1s. Thus, the head (hd) of the `pascal` stream is the stream `ones`.
- For **blank 2**: The tail (tl) of the `pascal` stream should be a suspended function that returns the next diagonal in the Pascal's Triangle. By definition, the (i+1)-th diagonal is the partial sums of the i-th diagonal. Hence, the next diagonal is generated by taking the stream described by `pascal` (which represents the i-th diagonal) and mapping it through the `psums` function (which computes partial sums), resulting in `psums pascal`.

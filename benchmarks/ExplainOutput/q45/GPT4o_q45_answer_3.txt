1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write:
   `ones`

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write:
   `map psums pascal`

**Explanation:**

1) The first diagonal of Pascal's triangle is a stream of ones (`ones`). This initializes the Pascal triangle construction.

2) The next diagonals are generated by computing the partial sums (`psums`) of the previous diagonal. Using `map psums pascal` applies the `psums` function to each stream (diagonal) of Pascal's triangle recursively via the lazy evaluation (`Susp`).

**Solution**
 
1) `fun () -> ones ;`
 
Explanation: ones is a stream of 1s already defined. So we bind the tl of pascal to a suspension that yields ones.

2) `pascal |> map (fun l -> last l);`

Explanation: We first get the stream l, and then we map Pascal onto that stream such that we get the Pascal Triangle for this stream with `map (fun l -> Pascal l)`, and then we take the last element of that resulting stream with `map (fun l -> last l)`.

1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write:
```ocaml
ones
```

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write:
```ocaml
map psums pascal
```

**Explanation:**

1) The first diagonal in Pascal's Triangle is the stream of `1`s, which is represented by `ones`.

2) Each subsequent diagonal is computed by taking the partial sums (`psums`) of the previous diagonal. We use `map` to apply `psums` to each stream (diagonal) in `pascal`. The recursive call makes the entire stream structure self-referential.

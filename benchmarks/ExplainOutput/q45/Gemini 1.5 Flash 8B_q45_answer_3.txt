1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write: `ones`

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write: `pascal_next (pascal_diagonal (fst (pascal)))`


**Explanation:**

1. **`ones`:** The first diagonal of Pascal's Triangle consists of just 1s.  This is represented by the `ones` stream.

2. **`pascal_next (pascal_diagonal (fst (pascal)))`:**
   - `pascal` is the stream of Pascal Triangles diagonals.
   - `fst (pascal)` gets the first diagonal of the original pascal stream.
   - `pascal_diagonal` calculates the next diagonal based on partial sums of the input diagonal.
   - `pascal_next` recursively generates the next diagonal based on the prior one, using partial sums.


**Important Considerations (not directly part of the answer, but crucial for understanding the complete implementation):**

* **`ones` Stream:** You need a definition for the `ones` stream. It's probably defined using `Stream.repeat`.
* **`pascal_diagonal` Function:** This function would take a given diagonal's stream and use `psums` to calculate the next diagonal according to the partial sums description.
* **`pascal_next` Function:** This function is crucial for using recursion to generate the stream of triangles. It would call `pascal_diagonal` as in the answer and construct a new suspended computation for the next level of the Pascal's Triangle.
* **`Stream` Module:**  You'll likely need constructs from the `Stream` module to make the suspensions work correctly and avoid premature computations.


```OCaml
(* Example implementation snippets (not complete) *)
let ones = Stream.repeat 1;;

let psums xs =
   let rec aux xs acc =
    match xs with
    | [] -> acc
    | x::xs' -> aux xs' (x::(List.map ((+) x) acc))
   in
   aux xs []

let pascal_diagonal diag =
    psums (Stream.of_list diag);;

let pascal_next prev_diag = 
    let diag_list = Stream.to_list prev_diag in
    let new_diag = pascal_diagonal diag_list in
           Stream.of_list new_diag

let rec pascal =
  { hd = ones;
    tl = Susp (fun () -> pascal_next (pascal_diagonal (fst (pascal))) )
  }
```

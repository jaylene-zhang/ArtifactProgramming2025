1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write: `1`

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write: `map psums pascal`

**Explanation:**
- The first diagonal of Pascal's Triangle starts with a single one, hence for blank 1 we use `1`.
- For blank 2, we generate the next diagonal by mapping the `psums` function over the current Pascal's Triangle stream (`pascal`). The `psums` function computes the partial sums, which gives us the next diagonal in the triangle based on the current one.

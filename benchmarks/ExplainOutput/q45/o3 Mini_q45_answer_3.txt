Solution:
1) ones
2) map psums pascal

Explanation:
The first diagonal of Pascal’s triangle is the stream of ones, so we set hd to ones. Each subsequent diagonal is the partial sums of the previous one; we obtain these by mapping psums over the pascal stream recursively, hence tl is defined as Susp (fun () -> map psums pascal).

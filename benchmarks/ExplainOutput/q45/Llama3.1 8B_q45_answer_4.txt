Here are the solutions:

1)
let rec pascal =
    { hd = Ones (**ones**);
      tl = Susp (fun () -> (psums (**psum**) (**ones**)) (**pascal**) )
    }
1) For blank in line 2 we should write `One`.
Explanation: We need to return the head of the Pascal triangle, which is always 1.

2)
let rec pascal =
    { hd = Ones (**ones**);
      tl = Susp (fun () -> (psums (**psum**) (**ones**)) (**pascal**) )
    }
2) For blank in line 3 we should write `<|> pascal`.
Explanation: We need to generate the rest of the Pascal triangle by adding the diagonals.
 `<|> pascal` is used to memoize all instances of `pascal` and use them without having to recompute `pascal` repeatedly. This is a common technique in functional programming known as memoization.

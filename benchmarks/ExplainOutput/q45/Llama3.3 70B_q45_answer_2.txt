### Solution
1) `ones`
2) `pascal psums`

### Explanation
1) The first diagonal in Pascal's triangle is a stream of ones, so we use the `ones` stream.
2) The `i + 1` diagonal in Pascal's triangle corresponds to the partial sums of the `i-th` diagonal. Therefore, we recursively call `pascal` on the partial sums (`psums`) of the current diagonal.

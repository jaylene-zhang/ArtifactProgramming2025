1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write: `1`

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write: `map psums pascal.tl` 

### Explanation:
- Blank 1: The first diagonal of Pascal's Triangle consists solely of 1s. Thus, the head (`hd`) of our stream is simply `1`.
  
- Blank 2: The tail (`tl`) of the stream is generated by applying the `psums` function to the tail of the current stream `pascal.tl`. The `psums` function computes the partial sums of a stream, which corresponds to the generation of the next diagonal in Pascal's Triangle from the current diagonal's elements. By continually applying this process, we can derive all the diagonals in the triangle.

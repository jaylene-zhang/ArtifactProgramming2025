**Solution:**

1.  `ones`
2.  `psums (map pascal)`

**Explanation:**

*   `hd = ones`: The first diagonal of Pascal's triangle is a stream of ones.
*   `tl = Susp (fun () -> psums (map pascal))`:  The tail of the `pascal` stream is a suspended computation (using `Susp`) that, when forced, computes the partial sums of the stream obtained by applying `pascal` itself to each element of the original `pascal` stream. This recursively generates subsequent diagonals. Each diagonal is the `psums` of the previous diagonal. The `map` applies the current `pascal` stream to make the process recursive.

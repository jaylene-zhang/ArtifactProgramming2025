**Solution**

1) `ones`
2) `pascal`

**Explanation**

1. The i + 1 diagonal is a stream of partial sums for the i-th diagonal. We need to generate the first diagonal, which is a stream of ones.
2. Then, we recursively generate the rest of the Pascal's triangle, which corresponds to the partial sums of the previous diagonal's partial sums.

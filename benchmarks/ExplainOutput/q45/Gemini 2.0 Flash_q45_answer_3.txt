Here's the solution and explanation:

**Solution:**

1.  `ones`
2.  `psums (pascal)`

**Explanation:**

*   **`hd = ones`**: The head of the `pascal` stream is the stream of ones, which represents the first diagonal of Pascal's triangle.
*   **`tl = Susp (fun () -> psums (pascal))`**: The tail of the `pascal` stream is a suspended computation that generates the rest of the diagonals. `psums (pascal)` calculates the partial sums of each diagonal (stream) in the `pascal` stream, creating the next diagonal in the triangle. The `Susp` makes it lazy.

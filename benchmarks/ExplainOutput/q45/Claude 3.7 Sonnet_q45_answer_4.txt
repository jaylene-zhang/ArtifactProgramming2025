1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write:
ones

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write:
map psums pascal

The first diagonal of Pascal's triangle is a stream of ones, so we start with `ones` as the head. For each subsequent diagonal, we need to compute the partial sums of the previous diagonal. The `map psums pascal` applies the partial sum function to each diagonal in the pascal stream, generating the next diagonal in the sequence.

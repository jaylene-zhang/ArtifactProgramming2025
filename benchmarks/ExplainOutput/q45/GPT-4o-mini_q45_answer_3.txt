1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write: 

```ocaml
1
```

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write:

```ocaml
map psums pascal
```

### Explanation:
1) The first diagonal of Pascal's triangle consists of a stream of ones, so we initialize it with `hd = 1`.
  
2) The `tl` (tail) of the stream is generated by applying the `psums` function to the `pascal` stream. This creates a new stream where each successive element corresponds to the partial sums of the elements in the previous diagonal (which is `pascal` itself). Using `map` allows us to transform the stream by calculating the sums efficiently.

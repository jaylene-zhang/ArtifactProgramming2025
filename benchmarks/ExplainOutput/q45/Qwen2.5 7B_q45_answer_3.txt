1) For blank 1 in line 2, we should write:
```ocaml
ones
```

2) For blank 2 in line 3, we should write:
```ocaml
fun () -> pascal |> psums
```

### Explanation

1) The first diagonal of Pascal's Triangle is just a stream of 1s. Therefore, the head of the stream (`hd`) pointed to by `pascal` is `ones` itself.

2) The tail of the stream (`tl`) is a suspended computation that returns the partial sums of the current diagonal. Each new diagonal in Pascal's Triangle is the partial sums of the previous diagonal. Therefore, `psums` of the current `pascal` stream is the computation that generates the next diagonal. This is wrapped in a function (suspended computation) to be evaluated lazily.

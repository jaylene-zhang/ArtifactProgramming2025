1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write:
   ```ones```

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write:
   ```map psums pascal```

**Explanation**:
1) The first diagonal of Pascal's triangle is a stream of ones, so `hd` of the `pascal` stream should be `ones`.
2) The remaining diagonals are generated using partial sums (`psums`) applied to each diagonal. We use `map` to apply `psums` to each diagonal in the `pascal` stream (`tl`). The `Susp` ensures laziness for the recursive definition.

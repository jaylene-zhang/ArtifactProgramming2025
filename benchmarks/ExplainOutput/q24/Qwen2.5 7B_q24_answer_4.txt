The type of the expression is `'t`.

### Explanation:
- Given: `f` has the type `('t * 't -> 't)`, meaning it takes a pair of type `'t * 't` and returns a value of type `'t`.
- Given: `a` and `b` are of type `'t`.

The expression `f (a, b)` has the type `'t` because `a` and `b` are both of type `'t`, so `f (a, b)` is valid and returns a value of type `'t`.

Similarly, `f (b, a)` also has the type `'t`.

Now, constructing `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))`:
- Both `f (a, b)` and `f (b, a)` are of type `'t`.
- Therefore, `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` is of type `'t` because `f` expects a pair of type `'t * 't` and returns a value of type `'t`.

Solution: 't

Explanation:
The function `f` takes two values of type `'t` and returns a value of type `'t`.  The first application `f (a, b)` produces a value of type `'t`.  The second application `f (b, a)` also produces a value of type `'t`.  These two results are then passed to `f` again, which returns a value of type `'t`.

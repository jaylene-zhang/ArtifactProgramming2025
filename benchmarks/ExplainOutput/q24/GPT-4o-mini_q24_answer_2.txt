The type of the expression `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` is `'t`.

Explanation: 

1. The function `f` has the type `('t * 't -> 't)`, meaning it takes a tuple of two elements of type `'t` and returns a value of type `'t`.
2. The expression `f (a, b)` has type `'t`, since `a` and `b` are both of type `'t`.
3. Similarly, `f (b, a)` also has type `'t`.
4. Thus, the expression `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` applies `f` to a tuple of the two results (`f(a, b)` and `f(b, a)`), both of which are of type `'t`, resulting in a final type of `'t`.

The type of the expression is `'t`.

Explanation:
- `f` has the type `('t * 't -> 't)`, meaning it takes a pair of type `'t * 't` and returns a value of type `'t`.
- `a` and `b` are both of type `'t`.

Thus, `f(a, b)` has type `'t` and `f(b, a)` also has type `'t`. Applying `f` to these results again, the expression `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` is `f` of two values of type `'t`, so it must also return a value of type `'t`.

**Solution:**

`'t`

**Explanation:**

1.  `f (a, b)` has type `'t`:
    *   `f` has type `('t * 't -> 't)`.
    *   `(a, b)` has type `('t * 't)`.
    *   Therefore, applying `f` to `(a, b)` results in a value of type `'t`.

2.  `f (b, a)` has type `'t`:
    *   Similar reasoning as above.

3.  `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` has type `'t`:
    *   `f (a, b)` has type `'t`.
    *   `f (b, a)` has type `'t`.
    *   Therefore, `(f (a, b), f (b, a))` has type `('t * 't)`.
    *   Applying `f` to this pair results in a value of type `'t`.

The expression has type 't.

Explanation:
Let's analyze the type step by step:
- f has type ('t * 't -> 't)
- a and b both have type 't
- f(a, b) has type 't (applying f to a pair of 't values)
- f(b, a) has type 't (same reason)
- This means f(f(a, b), f(b, a)) is applying f to two arguments of type 't
- Therefore the final result has type 't

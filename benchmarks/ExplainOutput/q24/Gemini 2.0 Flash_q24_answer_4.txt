**Solution:**

`'t`

**Explanation:**

1.  `f (a, b)` has type `'t` because `f` takes a tuple of type `'t * 't` and returns `'t`.
2.  `f (b, a)` also has type `'t` for the same reason.
3.  Therefore, `(f (a, b), f (b, a))` has type `'t * 't`.
4.  Finally, `f (f (a, b), f (b, a))` has type `'t` because `f` is applied to a tuple of type `'t * 't`.

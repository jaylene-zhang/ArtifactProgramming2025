```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * int) | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: The revised `cake` data type now includes a `Slice` variant that stores a tuple consisting of an `ingredients list` and an `int`, which represents the calories for that slice. The `Cake` variant remains unchanged, still representing a cake made of two smaller cakes.

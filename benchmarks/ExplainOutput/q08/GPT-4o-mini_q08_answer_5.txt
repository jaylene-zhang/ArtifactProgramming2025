```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * int) | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: The revised `cake` data type now defines a `Slice` as a tuple containing a list of `ingredients` and an `int` representing the calories. This allows the `Slice` to store both its composition and caloric information, while `Cake` remains unchanged, allowing for composite structures of cakes.

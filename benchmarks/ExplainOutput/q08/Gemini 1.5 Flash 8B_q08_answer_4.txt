```ocaml
type ingredients = string list
type calories = int

type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * calories) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**

The original `ingredients` type is kept. A new `calories` type is defined as `int`.  The `Slice` constructor now takes a tuple containing both the `ingredients` list and the `calories` value. This allows the calorie count to be associated with each slice. This revised type correctly reflects the requirement of storing calories with each slice.

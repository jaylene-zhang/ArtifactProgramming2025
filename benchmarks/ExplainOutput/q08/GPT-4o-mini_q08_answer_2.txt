```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * int) | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: In the revised definition of the `cake` type, the `Slice` constructor now takes a tuple containing a list of `ingredients` and an `int` representing the calories for that slice. The `Cake` constructor remains unchanged, still representing a cake made of two other cakes.

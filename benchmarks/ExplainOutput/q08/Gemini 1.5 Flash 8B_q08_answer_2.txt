```ocaml
type calorie = float
type ingredients = string list
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * calorie) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**

The original `ingredients` list is kept.  A new type `calorie` is introduced to store the calorie count, represented as a float.  The `Slice` constructor now takes a tuple containing the `ingredients` list and the `calorie` value. This is a crucial change for incorporating calories, maintaining the original structure.

Here is the revised data type for cake:

```ocaml
type calorie = int
type cake = 
  | Slice of (calories: calorie) * (ingredients: ingredients list)
  | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation:

We introduced a new type `calorie` to represent the calorie count. This is assumed to be an `int`, but could be any other type that represents calories if needed (e.g., `float`, `float array`, etc.). The `Slice` variant has been updated to hold a tuple of a calorie count and a list of ingredients.

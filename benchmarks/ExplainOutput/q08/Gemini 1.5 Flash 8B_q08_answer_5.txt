```ocaml
type ingredients = string list
type calories = int
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * calories) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**

The `ingredients` list is already given in the previous definition.  To add calories, we create a new type called `calories`, which is of type `int`.  Then, the `Slice` constructor takes a tuple containing both the `ingredients list` and `calories`.  This tuple is then correctly typed in the revised declaration.

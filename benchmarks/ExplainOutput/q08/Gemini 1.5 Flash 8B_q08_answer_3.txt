```ocaml
type ingredients = string list
type calories = int
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * calories) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**

The original `ingredients` type is reused.  A new `calories` type is introduced (integers represent calories).  The `Slice` constructor now takes a tuple of `ingredients list * calories`.  This neatly combines both pieces of information.

```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * int) | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: The revised `cake` type now defines a `Slice` as a tuple containing an `ingredients list` and an `int` which represents the number of calories. This modification allows each slice to store not only the ingredients but also its caloric value. The `Cake` constructor remains unchanged, representing a composite cake made of two cakes.

```ocaml
type cake = 
  Slice of (ingredients list * int) 
| Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: The `Slice` constructor now includes a tuple where the first element is the list of ingredients and the second element is the number of calories for that slice. This modification allows the `cake` data type to store both the ingredients and their corresponding calorie information.

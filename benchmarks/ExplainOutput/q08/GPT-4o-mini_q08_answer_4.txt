```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * int) | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: The revised `cake` type now includes a `Slice` constructor that holds a tuple consisting of an `ingredients list` and an `int` representing the calories for that slice. The `Cake` constructor remains unchanged, allowing for the composition of cakes.

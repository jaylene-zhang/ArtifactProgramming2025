Here is the revised data type for cake:

```ocaml
type calories = int
type cake = Slice of int * ingredients list | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation: We added a new type `calories` for storing the number of calories in each slice. We revised the `cake` data type to include an additional `int` value representing the calories for each slice of cake, in addition to the list of ingredients.

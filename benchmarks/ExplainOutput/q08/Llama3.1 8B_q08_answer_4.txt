**Solution**
```ocaml
type calorie = int
type cake = 
  | Slice of ingredients list * calorie
  | Cake of cake * cake
```
**Explanation**
We added a new type `calorie` to represent the number of calories in a slice, and modified the `Slice` constructor to take a tuple containing the list of ingredients and the calorie count.

Here is the revised data type for cake:

```ocaml
type calories = int
type slice = { ingredients : string list; calories : int }
type cake = Slice of slice | Cake of cake * cake
```

Explanation:
Added a new type alias `calories` as an `int` for the calorie count.
Created a new type alias `slice` to store a list of ingredients and an associated calorie count, represented as a record.
Updated the `cake` type to use the new `slice` type instead of just a list of ingredients.

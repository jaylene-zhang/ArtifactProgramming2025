```OCaml
type ingredients = string list
type calories = int
type cake = Slice of (ingredients * calories) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**

The original `ingredients` type is retained.  A new `calories` type is defined as `int`.  Crucially, the `Slice` constructor now takes a tuple `(ingredients * calories)`. This correctly combines the ingredient list with the calories for that slice.

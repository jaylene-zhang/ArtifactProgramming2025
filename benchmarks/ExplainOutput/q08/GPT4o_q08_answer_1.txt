```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (ingredients list * int) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**  
To store calories for each slice, we extend the `Slice` variant to hold a tuple `(ingredients list * int)`, where the `ingredients list` represents the ingredients and the `int` stores the calorie count. This modification allows each slice to store its own ingredients and calorie information.

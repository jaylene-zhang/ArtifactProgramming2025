**Solution:**

```ocaml
type cake = Slice of (int * ingredients list) | Cake of cake * cake
```

**Explanation:**

We want to store calories (an integer) along with the ingredients list for each `Slice`. Thus, we change the type of the `Slice` constructor's argument to a tuple `(int * ingredients list)`, where `int` represents the calories and `ingredients list` remains the list of ingredients.

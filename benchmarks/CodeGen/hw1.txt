Q1. The following function has been implemented incorrectly in the provided template.

let distance (x1, y1) (x2, y2) = 
  (y2-y1) + (x2- x1) 


distance : (int * int) -> (int * int) -> int which calculates the Manhattan distance between two points represented as tuples of integers. This is the distance one would travel by walking on a grid such as the streets of Manhattan, not the straight-line, Euclidean distance.
Before proceeding to fix the implementation, it is a good idea to understand what the algorithm should do. This algorithm calculates a distance. Distances have the following properties:

distance a a = 0 the distance from a point to itself is always zero
distance a b >= 0 distances are always non-negative
distance a b = distance b a distances are symmetric


correct the various syntax, type and logical errors contained in both functions' implementations.

(* TODO: Correct this implementation so that it compiles and returns
         the correct answers.
*)
let distance (x1, y1) (x2, y2) =
  (y2-y1) + (x2- x1)



Q2. The binomial coefficient B(n, k) is the coefficient that appears on the x^k term in the expansion of the binomial power (1 + x)^n. It can be calculated using the factorial function: B(n, k) = n! / (k! (n - k)!).

Implement the function binomial : int -> int -> int such that binomial n k computes B(n, k) using factorials.

Implement the helper function factorial : int -> int yourself as an inner helper function. You do not need to make the implementation of factorial tail-recursive.


(* TODO: Correct this implementation so that it compiles and returns
         the correct answers.
*)
let binomial n k =
  raise NotImplemented


Q3. The Lucas numbers form an integer sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence. They are defined by the following (recursive) equations:

L(0) = 2
L(1) = 1
L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)
Implement the function lucas : int -> int such that lucas n calculates L(n). Your implementation must be tail-recursive.
Hint: use an inner helper function with additional parameters to carry forward the values for L(n-1) and L(n-2).

(* TODO: Implement a tail-recursive helper lucas_helper. *)
let rec lucas_helper params =
  raise NotImplemented


(* TODO: Implement lucas that calls the previous function. *)
let lucas n =
  raise NotImplemented

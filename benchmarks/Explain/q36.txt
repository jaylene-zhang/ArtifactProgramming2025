Here is a function that "rotates" a list, placing the first element at the end :

let rotate l =
  match l with
  | []   -> []
  | h :: t   -> t @ [h]

What does the following function do to lists with at least five elements?

let rec f l =
  match l with
  | []   -> []
  | h :: t   -> rotate (t @ [h])

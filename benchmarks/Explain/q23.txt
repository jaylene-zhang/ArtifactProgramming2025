look at the following ocaml program:

```ocaml```
let point = (ref 4, ref 3)
let point' = point
let component_x (x,y) = x
let component_y (x,y) = y

let shift point =
let x = component_x point in
let y = component_y point in
x := !x + 1 ; y := !y + 1

let add p1 p2 =
let x1 = component_x p1 in
let y1 = component_y p1 in
let x2 = component_x p2 in
let y2 = component_y p2 in
x1 := !x2 + !x1 ; y1:= !y2 + !y1
```ocaml```


What is the type of shift?

Identify those implementation(s) that provide a correct, tail-recursive implementation
for the function fold_right.

i.e. we we can pass to aux_foldr the same function
f and same list l and simply need to initialize the continuation appropriately such
that calling aux_foldr will compute the same result as fold_right f l b.


a) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont b
    | x :: xs -> aux_folder f xs b (fun r -> cont (f x r))

b) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont b
    | x :: xs -> aux_folder f xs b (fun r -> f (cont r) x)

c) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont b
    | x :: xs -> aux_folder f xs b (fun r -> f x (cont r))

d) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont b
    | x :: xs -> aux_folder f xs b (fun r -> cont (f r x))

e) let rec aux_folder f l b cont = match l with
    | [] -> cont b
    | x :: xs -> aux_folder xs f b (fun r -> f (cont r) x)

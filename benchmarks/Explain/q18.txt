Consider the following OCaml program.

```ocaml```
let point = (5, 4)
let component_x (x,y) = x
let component_y (x,y) = y
let shift_point n =
(component_x point + n , component_y point + n)
let point = shift_point 1
```ocaml```

After loading the above program, what will the program shift_point 2 return?

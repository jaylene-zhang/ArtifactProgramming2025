We plan on adding some code optimizations to OCaml by inlining expressions. Inlining is the process of preemptively substituting a variable with its definition, to avoid performing the substitution later, during evaluation.

5. Consider the following program:
let foo y =
let x = y + 3 in
let w = x in fun y -> x + 2 + y * w

We want to inline y+3 by replacing occurrences of x in
let w = x in fun y -> x + 2.

What is the resulting program?

Pascal's Triangle - Part A
We want to generate all diagonals in the Pascal triangle, starting with the stream of ones as a first diagonal.
The i + 1 diagonal in the triangle corresponds to the partial sums of the stream described by the i-th diagonal.
You can assume that ones describes a stream of 1s.


Fill in the blank in the template for generating all diagonals in the pascal triangle below.
Hint: Use map and psums.

let rec pascal =
    { hd = (**blank 1**);
      tl = Susp (fun () -> (**blank 2**) )
    }


1) For blank 1 in line 2 we should write:

2) For blank 2 in line 3 we should write:

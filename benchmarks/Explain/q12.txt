Question 4: Heartache for Everyone (Inductive Proof)

Q4.1

Below we give two functions which adds up how many cards are in a hand.

let rec add_up h = match h with
| Empty -> 0
| Hand (c, h) -> add_up h + 1

let rec add_up_tr h acc = match h with
| Empty -> acc
| Hand (c, h) -> add_up_tr h (1+acc)

Prove that for all h:hand, add_up h = add_up_tr h 0. As we cannot prove this statement directly, we prove the following more general statement.

Theorem 1. For all hands h and accumulators acc, add_up h + acc = add_up_tr h acc. Proof. By structural induction on h.
• Base Case:
    h=
• Step Case:
    h= .

State your induction hypothesis:
      Proof:

Q4.2

Theorem 2 (Main Result). For all hands h , add_up h = add_up_tr h 0.

Proof.

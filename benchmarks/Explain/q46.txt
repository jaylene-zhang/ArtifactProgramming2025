Folding

We want to write a fold on streams.
Since our stream is infinite, we want to fold over finite prefixes of a stream using a function f together with some initial value we pass to f.
For example, fold f a0 s returns the output stream where we illustrate the relationship between the input and output stream below:

input stream s = a1, a2, a3, ...
output stream r = f a1 a0, f a2 (f a1 a0), f a3 (f a2 (f a1 a0)), ...

let rec fold f a s =
    {hd = (** blank 1 **);
    tl = (** blank 2**)}


1) For blank 1 we should write:

2) For blank 2 we should write:

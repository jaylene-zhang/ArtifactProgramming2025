For n ≥ 0, the n-th triangle number is the result of 1 + 2 + ... + n.

Here is a function that attempts to calculate triangle numbers. However, it is not correct.

```ocaml```

let rec triangle n =
  if n = 1 then 1
  else n + triangle (n - 1)

```ocaml```

Without loading this code into an OCaml interpreter, will the following tests pass this buggy implementation?

** testcase **

triangle 0 == 0

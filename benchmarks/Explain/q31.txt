Understanding when computation happens is important, since it give us a deeper understanding of the performance of a piece of code.

Integer factorization is the decomposition of a positive integer into a product
of smaller integers. If these factors are further restricted to prime numbers,
the process is called prime factorization. We assume that the factorization is
given as a increasing ordered list of integers.

Assume we have a function prime_fact : int -> int list which
computes the prime number factorization of a given number. We now want to write
a function that checks whether a given list of integer factorizations contains
the prime number factorization of a prime number n.

Below are implementations of

check_prime_factors: int -> (int list) list -> bool

Identify if they only computes the function prime_fact once in order to check for prime factorizations in the given input list.

a) let check_prime_factors x =
let p = prime_fact x in List.exists (fun e -> e = p)

b) let check_prime_factors x l =
List.exists (fun e -> e = prime_fact x) l

c) let check_prime_factors x l = match l with
| [] -> false
| y::ys -> y = prime_fact x || check x ys

d) let check_prime_factors x l =
let p = prime_fact x in
let rec test l = match l with
| [] -> false
| y::ys -> y = p || test ys
in test l

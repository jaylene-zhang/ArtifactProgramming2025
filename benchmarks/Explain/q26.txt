Below we define the type of a linked list together with the function
get_tail which returns the tail of a linked list, if it exists.

```ocaml```
type 'a rlist =
| Nil
| Cons of 'a * 'a rcell
and 'a rcell = ('a rlist) ref

let get_tail rc = match !rc with Cons (_ , t) -&gt; t
```ocaml```

We now execute the following code:

```ocaml```

let rc1 = ref (Cons (1, ref Nil))
let rc2 = ref (Cons (2, rc1))
rc1 := !rc2
```ocaml```



We have now created a cyclic list. Will the following return true?
( Recall that == tests physical equality, i.e. whether the locations in memory are the same.)

get_tail rc1 == get_tail rc2

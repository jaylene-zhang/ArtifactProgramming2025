We plan on adding some code optimizations to OCaml by inlining expressions.
Inlining is the process of preemptively substituting a variable with its
definition, to avoid performing the substitution later, during evaluation.

What is the result of substituting y by (f x) in the expression?

let double x = 
  let x = 2 in
  let w = y + x in
  fun f -> (f w) * y

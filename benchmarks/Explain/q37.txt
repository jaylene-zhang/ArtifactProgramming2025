For n ≥ 0, the n-th triangle number is the result of 1 + 2 + ... + n.

Here is a function that attempts to calculate triangle numbers. However, it is not correct.

```ocaml```
let rec triangle n =
    if n = 1 then 1
    else n + triangle (n-1)

```ocaml```

Give the input and output of a test that will not pass and identify the bug in the implementation.

Give an input - output pair as an answer.

For example: (3 , 7) where 3 is the input and 7 is the output. Separate the input from the output using a comma surrounded by a space.

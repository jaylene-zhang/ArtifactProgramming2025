Fill in the blank.

We now want to implement a function toInt that takes in a function f:’a -> ’a&nbsp;and an argument x:’a and tests how many times the function f is applied to x. It essentially does the reverse of create and should behave as follows:
toInt (fun f x -> x) returns 0
toInt (fun f x -> f x) returns 1
toInt (fun f x -> f(f(x))) returns 2
...
In general, toInt (create n) should evaluate to n.

let toInt f = (*to be filled*)

What should we write for the blank?

To find the largest power of two that evenly divides a given integer `n`, we can count the number of times `k` we can evenly divide `n` by two. Then, `2^k` is the largest power of two that evenly divides`n`.

Identify whether the following implementations calculates the largest power of two that divides a number correctly and in a tail-recursive fashion.

```ocaml```

let rec helper n =
  if n mod 2 = 1 then 1
  else 2 * helper (n / 2)
let max_two_factor n = helper 1 n

```ocaml```

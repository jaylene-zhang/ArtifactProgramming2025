Question 2: State Changes
What is the result of evaluating the expression below using OCaml’s call-by-value strategy? – Show the binding stack to explain your reasoning and answer. Be concise

let x = 3 in
let r = ref (2 + x) in
let f = (let y = x * !r in
let r = ref 4 in fun u -> u + x + y + !r ) in
let x = 5 in
let y = 10 in
r := 2 ; f (!r * y)

An example for a valid binding stack is like below:

expressions:
let x = 3;;
let f () = x;;
let x = 4;

binding stack:
x = 4
f ----> () -> x
x = 3

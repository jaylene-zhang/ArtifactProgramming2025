What is the final result of running the program below. Explain your answer using binding stack diagram.

let c = ref 0 in
let l = List.rev [1;2;3] in let observe () = !c in
let x = 1 in
let inc x = c:= !c+1 ; x+1 in let ml = List.map inc l in let inc’ = (let c = ref 0 in
let x = x + 1 in fun y -> c := !c+1 ; !c+y+x) in let ml’ = List.map inc’ l in
(x,observe () , ml, ml’)

An example for a valid binding stack is like below:

expressions:
let x = 3;;
let f () = x;;
let x = 4;

binding stack:
x = 4
f ----> () -> x
x = 3

In Figure Skating, the athletes receive points for their artistry and also for their jumps.
In official competitions, the allowed jumps are: Axel, Lutz, Flip, Loop, Salchow.
Each jump has a number of revolutions associated with it.
For example, a Triple Loop is a Loop jump where the athlete performs three revolutions in the air.
By performing more rotations, it is possible to obtain better scores: a triple jump is worth more than a double; but today's athletes can go over 3 rotations.
Without considering further technical details of the sport, we want to create a data type that represents the main jumps in figure skating.

Select the implementation that captures the previous description:

a) type revolutions = int
type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions

b) type jump_typ = Axel | Loop | Lutz | Flip | Salchow
type revolutions = Double | Triple
type jump = jump_typ * revolutions

c) type jump =
| Axel of jump * int
| Loop of jump * int
| Lutz of jump * int
| Flip of jump * int
| Salchow of jump * int

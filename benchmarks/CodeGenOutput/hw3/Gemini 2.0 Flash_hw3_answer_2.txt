(* Question 1a: Church numeral to integer *)
(* TODO: Implement to_int
   Although the input n is of type int church, please do not be confused. This is due to typechecking reasons, and for
   your purposes, you could pretend n is of type 'b church just like in the other problems.
*)
let to_int (n : int church) : int = n 0 (fun x -> x + 1)

(* Question 1b: Add two church numerals *)
(* TODO: Implement add)
let add (n1 : 'b church) (n2 : 'b church) : 'b church = fun z s -> n1 z s |> n2 z s

(* Question 1c: Multiply two church numerals *)
(* TODO: Implement mult)
let mult (n1 : 'b church) (n2 : 'b church) : 'b church = fun z s -> n1 (n2 z s) s


Implement the functions:

sum : 'a church list -> 'a church to sum a list of church numerals into one church numeral. Your solution must use the built-in function List.fold_left. No recursive calls are allowed.
length : 'a list -> 'b church to compute the length of the list as a church numeral.

(* Question 2a: Sum a list of church numerals *)
(* TODO: implement sum *)

let sum (l : 'b church list) : 'b church = List.fold_left (fun acc n -> add acc n) (fun z s -> z) l

(* Question 2b: Compute the length of a list as a church numeral *)
(* TODO: implement length *)

(* Tthe length function itself should accept any 'a
   list, not just int list. So you should not assume any properties about individual elements in the list. *)
let length (l : 'a list) : 'b church = List.fold_left (fun acc _ -> add acc (fun z s -> s z)) (fun z s -> z) l

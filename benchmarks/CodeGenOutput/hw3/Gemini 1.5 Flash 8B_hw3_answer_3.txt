(* Question 1a: Church numeral to integer *)
(* TODO: Implement to_int
   Although the input n is of type int church, please do not be confused. This is due to typechecking reasons, and for
   your purposes, you could pretend n is of type 'b church just like in the other problems.
*)
let to_int (n : int church) : int =
  n 0 succ

(* Question 1b: Add two church numerals *)
(* TODO: Implement add)
let add (n1 : 'b church) (n2 : 'b church) : 'b church =
  fun z s -> n1 z (fun x -> n2 x s)

(* Question 1c: Multiply two church numerals *)
(* TODO: Implement mult)
let mult (n1 : 'b church) (n2 : 'b church) : 'b church =
  fun z s -> n1 (n2 z s) s

(* Question 2a: Sum a list of church numerals *)
(* TODO: implement sum *)

let sum (l : 'b church list) : 'b church =
  List.fold_left (fun acc n -> add acc n) (fun z s -> z) l

(* Question 2b: Compute the length of a list as a church numeral *)
(* Tthe length function itself should accept any 'a
   list, not just int list. So you should not assume any properties about individual elements in the list. *)
let length (l : 'a list) : 'b church =
  List.fold_left (fun n _ -> succ n) (fun z s -> z) l

The issue is in the `Apply` case where you're trying to use `::` (cons) operator on lists incorrectly. You need to build a list of substitutions to pass to `subst_list`.

```ocaml
let rec eval exp =
  match exp with
  (* Values evaluate to themselves *)
  | I _ -> exp
  | B _ -> exp
  | Fn _ -> exp

  (* This evaluator is _not_ environment-based. Variables should never
     appear during evaluation since they should be substituted away when
     eliminating binding constructs, e.g. function applications and lets.
     Therefore, if we encounter a variable, we raise an error.
*)
  | Var x -> raise (Stuck (Free_variable x))

  (* Primitive operations: +, -, *, <, = *)
  | Primop (po, args) ->
      let args = List.map eval args in
      begin
        match eval_op po args with
        | None -> raise (Stuck Bad_primop_args)
        | Some v -> v
      end

  | If (e, e1, e2) ->
      begin
        match eval e with
        | B true -> eval e1
        | B false -> eval e2
        | _ -> raise (Stuck If_non_true_false)
      end

  | Let (x, e1, e2) ->
      let e1 = eval e1 in
      eval (subst (e1, x) e2)

  | Rec (f, _, e) -> eval (subst (exp, f) e)

  | Apply (e, es) -> 
      
      match eval e with
      | Fn (inputs, e) -> 
          if (List.length inputs != List.length es) then 
            raise (Stuck Arity_mismatch) (*incorrect number of arguments*)
          else 
            let evaluated_args = List.map eval es in
            let arg_pairs = List.combine evaluated_args (List.map fst inputs) in
            eval (subst_list arg_pairs e)
      | _ -> raise (Stuck Apply_non_fn)
